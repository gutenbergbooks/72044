</div>


<p>In presenting a third volume of the Nature Readers to the
children of our land, and to their parents and teachers, I feel
it both a duty and a delight to thank those who have so cordially
and sympathetically welcomed a new departure in School-Book
Literature.</p>

<p>I have not sought to model these Readers upon any pattern
previously set, but to make them the outcome of what I have
learned, by observation, of the receptive and retentive powers
of children.</p>

<p>I desired to impart useful and needful knowledge, in a
fashion which should not be burdensome, and which should
strongly impress young minds.</p>

<p>I have had no hobby of book-making, nor of style to follow.
My one idea has been to benefit the child, and to that
end I have directed my whole effort.</p>

<p>I sing an old song when I say, that we are a nervous race,
and our children are more intensely nervous than their parents.
The antidote for this nervousness, and its consequent train of
disasters, is to be found in the open air, in healthful out-of-door
exercise, in the serene calm of nature, in the peaceful
joys which the investigation of nature affords us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>If we can open wide the gates of “the fairy-land of
science,”—if we can bring the child near to the heart of nature,—if
we can absorb his hours of leisure, and many of his hours
of brain-work, in the study of nature out of doors, we shall
have done much toward making him robust in body, sound in
mind, cheerful of disposition, and useful in the future.</p>

<p>Once more we are going out together by the Sea-side
and the Way-side. We shall now learn more of
our Great Mother, the Earth, and of her many children.</p>

<p>Once I read a tale of a queen, who gave all that she
had to her youngest son, and ordered all his brothers
and sisters to be his servants. I did not think that
that was fair.</p>

<p>But something very like this has happened to us in
this world. We human beings are the last and youngest
of living things, and yet all the rest serve us, and
are for our use. In this book I shall tell you the secret
of this. I shall tell you of the flowers and trees; they
are the earth’s eldest children. I shall tell you how
they have taken insects and birds for their partners,
and have gone into business, to feed the world.</p>

<p>We shall look at those pretty partners in their work
and play.</p>

<p>The birds have some lovely stories to tell us in
their songs.</p>

<p>And then, we shall put on some new spectacles, and
look into the brooks, and ponds, and into the rivers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
and seas, and see the Fin Family, which feel so safe,
hiding deep down in the waters.</p>

<p>And when you have learned a little of the wonderful
way in which all the parts of the world fit together,
and work together, I want you to think how wise and
good is the great God who made all.</p>

<h2>LESSON I.</h2>

<p class="ph3">THE GREAT MOTHER.</p>


<p>“What are you doing?” I asked a boy to-day.</p>

<p>“Only digging in the dirt,” he said.</p>

<p>“And what is that in your little cart?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but dirt.”</p>

<p>“And what is this that you call dirt?”</p>

<p>He did not reply. An older boy, who had read more,
said: “Dirt is the top crust of the ball, called the
earth, on which we live.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“Very good. Now my lad, what is dirt worth?”</p>

<p>The boy who was digging said: “Ho! Dirt is worth
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Suppose that I could take away from you all that
you get from the earth. What would you have
left?”</p>

<p>“Many things,” said the little boy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the older boy, “we should have no fruit,
nor vegetables, for these come from the ground.
We should have no bread. Wheat grows from
the ground. No sugar, for sugar is made of beets
and sugar-cane.”</p>

<p>“And,” I said, “you would have no milk, butter, or
cheese. For the cows must eat grass and other
plants, from which to make milk.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said the big boy. “And, since it is so,
you may say we should have no meat. The
animals must eat plants, of some kind, or they
could not live and grow.”</p>

<p>The boy who was digging now looked at the dirt with
more respect.</p>

<p>“So you would lose all your food. For food is animal
or vegetable, and so comes from the dirt. Let us
see about your clothes. You would lose all cotton
and linen clothes. For cotton and flax grow out
of the ground. You would lose all silk, woollen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and leather, clothes. The silk-worms, sheep, and
other animals feed on plants that grow in the
dirt. You must lose your straw hats also. Straw
is the stem of a plant.”</p>

<p>“I should have my house,” said the boy who was
digging.</p>

<p>“Let us see about that. Your house is made of stone,
brick, or wood, plaster, paint. All these things
come from the earth. Bricks are clay, burned.
Wood grew in the ground as trees. Plaster is
lime, sand, and so on; these come from the earth.
The paint is made of oil and ground minerals.
We get these minerals from the earth. If I could
take from you all you have from the earth, you
would have no house, nor food, nor clothes. You
must go and sit out-of-doors, in a very sad state.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said the boy, “I should have my little iron
shovel, and my little iron cart.”</p>

<p>“No, you would not,” said the big boy. “Iron is dug
out of the earth. You would have no stove, no
knives, no such things as pots, and pans, to cook
in! Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“I have a box full of pennies,” said the small boy,
“and dimes, and gold dollars; I would buy more
things.”</p>

<p>“All your money will be gone with the rest of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
losses. The pennies, dimes, dollars, are made of
metals. Metals come from rocks that are found
in the earth,” I said. “Also, all the dishes in
your house are made of clay and metal. You
would have to lose them. All your furniture is of
wood, metal, and leather, you would have to lose
that. But you would soon starve without food.
So it makes little matter what else you lose.”</p>

<p>“I should sit on the sea-shore, and catch fish to eat!”
cried the small boy.</p>

<p>“You must then catch them without hook, net, or line.
But let us begin on the fish, and take away all
that feed on sea plants. Next let us take away all
that feed on fish that have fed on plant-life. Soon
you will be in a sad way for fish to catch.”</p>

<p>“So all that we have comes from the earth?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The earth is a great treasure box, out of which
come all things which we see about us. It is for
this reason that we say, ‘Mother Earth.’ In old
times people said the earth was the great mother
of all things. So do not speak with scorn of that
dirt, which is ‘the earth’s top-crust.’ What would
you <i>have</i> without it?</p>

<p>“What would you <i>be</i> without it? Your flesh, blood,
bones, are built up of what you eat and drink. If
all the things that come out of the earth were
taken from you, you would soon perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“Just now you found that you would have no house to
live in, and no clothes to wear. So, soon your
mind and soul would have no body-house to live
in; no flesh-clothes to wear. Every part of you,
except the mind and soul part, comes from the
earth.</p>

<p>“When we look at the earth that which we first notice
is the plant, or vegetable. By plants we mean the
trees, grasses, and other things, which grow out of
the soil. Plants are Mother Earth’s first children.</p>

<p>“Beside the plants which grow in the soil, there are
plants which are called air-plants, because they
grow in the air. Also there are plants which grow
in water. These are called water, or aquatic
plants.”</p>

<p>We will now have some lessons on plant-life.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE EARTH’S ELDEST CHILD.</p>


<p>Perhaps you have looked at the books of some of the
elder pupils in your school. Did you see one
marked “<i>Botany</i>”? Did you see in it pictures
of flowers, and parts of flowers? Botany is the
study of plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>These lessons in your Nature Reader are not to teach
you botany. They are only to tell you some of
the curious things about plants. When you read
these lessons, you will like plants, not only because
they are so very pretty and useful, but because of
the wonders of the plant-world.</p>

<p>I shall tell you some of the secrets of the wonder-world
of plants. Then I hope you will wish to find out
more of the secrets for yourselves.</p>

<p>I once asked Tom, “What is a plant?”</p>

<p>“A plant!” cried Tom, “oh, a plant is—a potato, a
turnip;” and off he went, quite satisfied with his
answer.</p>

<p>He was content, because he knew so little. If he had
known more, his answer would not have suited
him so well.</p>

<p>You will get a peep at the wonders of plant-life from
this little story. I said to a class of girls, who
had studied botany for a year: “What is a plant?
I will give you half an hour to find an answer
that will suit you.”</p>

<p>One girl said in a hurry: “A plant is not a living
thing!”</p>

<p>“O you silly girl!” cried all the rest. “A plant grows.
Only living things can grow. Why do you say
‘a living tree,’ and ‘a dead tree,’ if plants are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
living things? Did you never see a plant dying
or dead?”</p>

<p>“A plant,” said another, “is a living thing that does
not breathe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it does breathe. It breathes air.”</p>

<p>“A plant is a living thing that eats only minerals.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but some plants eat little bugs, and meat.”</p>

<p>“A plant is a living thing that does not move.”</p>

<p>“It does move! Does not the vine climb up the tree,
or by the side of the house? Do not some flowers
turn each day to follow the path of the sun?
Does not the wild ivy run over the ground? Then
there is a plant in the desert that moves to find
water. It gets loose from the sand. It bends up
into a circle or wheel. Then the wind rolls it
along, until it reaches a moist place where it can
live. There it roots again.”</p>

<p>“A plant is a living thing without blood.”</p>

<p>“Its sap, or juice, is its blood. It serves the plant as
blood serves man. The sap is as much the blood of
the plant as the white fluid in the jelly-fish, the
insect, or the barnacle, is blood for them.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> All
animals do not have thick, red blood.”</p>

<p>“A plant is a thing that does not sleep,” said one
girl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, but plants <i>do</i> sleep. We learned that once.”</p>

<p>“A plant is a living thing, without feelings.”</p>

<p>“Some of them seem to have feeling. They move or
shrink when you touch them. A star-fish, as he
breaks himself up, does not seem to have more
feeling than a plant.”</p>

<p>“Let us say,” said one, “that a plant is a live thing,
that grows in the soil.”</p>

<p>“But there are plants that grow only in air, or in
water, or in other plants. There are plenty of
plants that grow in bread, cheese, milk, and preserves.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Finally they said: “A plant is a living thing, generally
rooted in the earth, and growing from a seed,
or something like a seed. A plant has no brain,
and no nerves.”</p>

<p>Their teacher told them that the great point about a
plant is, that the plant eats minerals and turns
them into other substances. Animals get most of
the mineral food that they eat from the plants,
after the plants have made it over.</p>

<p>Now, from what this class said, you have learned some
of the curious things about plants. Plants live,
breathe, grow, move, eat, drink, and sleep.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>More than this, I shall show you how plants serve for
clocks. Plants also can tell you about the weather,
whether it will be wet or dry.</p>

<p>And the plants have gone into business, and have partners.
The birds and insects are the plant’s
partners. The plants live, and grow, and go into
business, just to make other plants. But the end
of the business is, that the world is fed.</p>

<p>Do you now think that you should like to learn about
plants? Here are a few facts to begin with.</p>

<p>Plants are so different in size that they are among the
largest and the smallest things in the world. The
great trees in California are so large that a hundred
people can stand upon one stump. They are
as tall as the tallest towers in the world. Twenty
men on horses can ride into the hollow of one
tree. Other very great trees are found in other
parts of the world.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The largest trees are in
Australia and California.</p>

<p>In other places there are also very big trees. In New
Jersey I once saw a large, hollow tree, in which a
goat lived. He was a big goat. He jumped about
and slept inside the tree. When the children
called him he came out to draw their cart. In
another hollow tree I saw a very nice play-house.</p>

<p>While some plants are so large, others are very small.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
There is a little pond weed, which, root and all, is
not so big as a grain of rice. Other plants are as
small as pin heads. Others are so small that you
cannot see them without a microscope.</p>

<p>Plants differ as much in age as in size. Some grow
and die in a few hours, or a day. Others live only
a year. Some trees are said to live three thousand
years.</p>

<p>There are plants that have flowers, and plants that
never have any flowers. There are plants that
grow from the outside in, other plants grow from
the inside out.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> If you like plants, and some day
study Botany, you will find out about all these
things.</p>

<p class="ph3">A LOOK AT A PLANT.</p>


<p>Plants are divided into two great classes. One class
contains all plants with flowers. The other class
contains plants that have no flowers. The plants
with flowers are the ones which you like best.
They are of the most interest to you. Besides
this, they are the easiest to learn about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp39" id="i_020" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A CHILD OF THE GARDEN.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A piece of
moss is
a flowerless
plant.
What you call a
“simple bit of moss,”
would be harder to
learn about than a
whole garden full of
lilies and roses.</p>

<p>The plants with flowers
are the most perfect
plants. They are
also the most beautiful,
and the most
useful. A perfect
plant has six parts
for you to notice:
1, the root; 2, the
stem; 3, leaves; 4,
blossoms (the blossom
is made of several
parts); 5, a bag
or box for seeds; 6,
seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Here are all those parts shown in our picture of a
pea-vine. You see our pea-vine has something
else. It has little curly things with which to
climb. They are its hands for taking hold of
objects. They are leaves, buds, or twigs, that
have changed. They are now tendrils. They
grew slim, and long, and curly, as the plant had
need of them for climbing.</p>

<p>Some plants do not have all these parts. Some have
no stems. Have you not found little plants without
stems? The leaves and flowers sit close upon
the earth. Some plants have no leaves.</p>

<p>Sometimes parts of the flower are gone. Instead of a
fine flower there may be only a little scale, with
a bunch of small threads lying upon it.</p>

<p>Now let us take a little look at the parts of a perfect
plant. We just want to see the great variety in
them. We will learn also of what use they are to
the plant.</p>

<p>Of what use are roots? The root is the plant’s anchor
to hold it firm in its place. The root is the plant’s
pantry or cellar, where much of its food is stored
up. The root is the plant’s mouth. Many of
the mouths of the plant are on the ends of the
little fibres that grow from the main part of the
root. Get some plant roots and look at the fringe-like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
slender fibres. These little mouths under
ground are eating, eating, eating, all the time.
They eat all kinds of minerals held in water in
the earth.</p>

<p>Roots last one, two, or many years. Where the root
lasts one year, the plant is soft and juicy. Where
the root lasts over one year, the plant is often
more or less hard and woody.</p>

<p>Roots differ much in shape. Pull up some grass. That
has roots like a bunch of coarse threads. When I
was a child I was much pleased to learn that it
was such slim, thread-like roots that held together
the earth of the Holland coast, so the sea could
not wash it away.</p>

<p>Get a carrot from the garden or market. What a long
wedge-like root it has. The radish is a slimmer
root. The beet has the same general shape, but
is thicker. The turnip is round. The dahlia has
rough, knobby roots of many shapes.</p>

<p>But, in fact, all these thick parts which we call roots
are not true roots. The real true roots are the
little fibres with mouths at the ends. These thick,
round, wedge-shaped, or knobby, parts, are stems,
or parts of stems, that grow under ground.</p>

<p>Now and then, if a tree or plant is set in the earth,
top down, the roots will put out leaves and buds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
This shows that they are underground stems, or
branches.</p>

<p>“What kind of a root is a potato?” asks Bobby. A
potato is not a root. It is a thick underground
stem. The real potato roots are the little fibres.</p>

<p>“What kind of root is an onion?” says Mary. An onion
is not a root, it is a bud or bulb. The scales are
leaves that have grown white and thick. The
real roots of the onion are the fibres that hang in
a bunch under the round part.</p>

<p>Roots are of many colors. They are brown, white, red,
yellow, pink, orange.</p>

<p>Roots of many plants are useful to men for food. They
also have stored up in them the food on which
the plant lives.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the plant stem. See this lily stem.
It dies down each year. It is soft and hollow, and
full of water. Cut down a rose stem. That lives
a number of years. It is hard and woody.</p>

<p>Some stems have leaves growing upon them, some
have none. Some are smooth, others are jointed.
Have you seen the joints or rings on a corn-stalk?</p>

<p>Some stems are erect, as the trunks of trees. Some
stems climb, as that of the vine; some creep along
the ground, as those of the strawberry.</p>

<p>Some stems are round, some square; some are smooth;
some are rough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>The color of most stems is green, or brown. Sometimes
they are yellow, or of other colors. The corn
stem is pale yellow. It has joints. From some of
these lower joints you will see roots growing out,
and reaching down to fasten in the ground. They
act as tent cords; they help hold the stalk firm in
the earth.</p>

<p>The trunk of a great tree is a stem; so is the fine stalk
of a violet. You see how they differ in size. But
different kinds of stems have different names.</p>

<p>Of what use are stems? To the plant the stem is of
use, as it holds the leaves, and flowers, and fruit,
up into the air and sun. Also the stem is made
up of the tubes or pipes which carry the sap, and
the food it holds, through all the plant.</p>

<p>Plant stems are very useful to men. The stems of
trees give us wood for fuel, and to build ships
and houses, and to make furniture. Some stems
are also good for food. The stems of flax give us
linen.</p>

<p>Now let us look at leaves. What can you tell me
about leaves? You will say they are mostly
green, but some are of other colors. You will tell
me that some are thick, some are thin. Some
have veins like a net, some have straight veins.
Some leaves are smooth, some rough, or downy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Some leaves are long, like those of the yellow lily;
some are round, like those of the water lily.
Some are shaped like hearts, some like arrows,
some like shields. Some have smooth edges,
some have edges pointed or scalloped. Suppose
you count and see how many kinds of leaves
you find?</p>

<p>Of what use are leaves? By the leaves the plant
breathes. But I shall tell you more about the use
of leaves to the plant some other time. Leaves
are of use to man. They make a lovely shade.
Some leaves are good for food. Out of some
leaves cloth, hats, and other useful things, are
made.</p>

<p>Leaves differ much in size. There are big palm leaves,
ten feet wide. Other leaves are as small as a
grain of rice.</p>

<p>Most leaves die and drop from the trees in the fall
of the year. But some leaves stay green all
winter.</p>

<p>The part of the plant which you like best is the flower.
The flower has the most of the color, and the
most of the fragrance of the plant. In the flower
cup is that drop of honey which the insects like.</p>

<p>Let us look at a buttercup flower. First, here is a
ring of what you call five green leaves. They
form a cup to hold the flower. Next to these you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
find a row of bright yellow leaves. These are
the petals. Inside there is a little bunch of fine
fringe. This fringe is of two kinds. The outside
threads are stamens, the middle ones pistils.</p>

<p>The stamens have on them the pollen, or yellow dust,
of which you have heard.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> At the bottom of the
pistil is the little seed case or bag. This case
grows. It holds the seeds. The other parts of
the flower fade and fall. The seed case grows and
grows, and the seeds grow in it.</p>

<p>The seed cup, or case, is of many shapes and sizes. I
shall tell you more of the seed and its case some
other time.</p>

<p>Flowers differ as much or more than leaves in shape,
color, size. They differ also in smell. Some smell
sweet; some smell bad; some have no smell.
Sometimes the flower cup is all in one piece, sometimes
it is in two, three, five, or very many pieces.</p>

<p class="ph3">A YEAR IN A PLANT’S LIFE.</p>


<p>Now you shall hear the story of a plant’s life. The
life-story I shall tell you is of a plant that lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
one year. This story begins with a seed and ends
with a seed.</p>

<p>The story of any plant would be this, only that the
story of some plant-lives would run through many
years. During these years they would ripen many
crops of seeds.</p>

<p>Let us take the story of a bean’s life. We choose this
because a bean has a plain and simple story. All
its parts are large enough to see. Any one of
you can get beans to help tell the story.</p>

<p>To enjoy this story you should get a bowl, or pot, of
earth, and seven beans. Now first look closely at
these beans. They have a thick shining skin.
Break open one bean. It is made in two halves,
which have a little seam around them longwise.
On the middle of one side is a dent. Your mother
will tell you that is the <i>bean’s eye</i>. This dent
goes through the outer skin.</p>

<p>Now soak your other six beans in water for a few
hours. If you soak them they will sprout sooner
when you plant them. Now put one bean in the
middle of the pot, or bowl, of earth, and the other
five around the sides. Do not bury them too deep.
Let about half an inch of earth lie over them.
Keep the earth moist. Set the pot in the sun and
in fresh, but not too cold, air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>When you took your beans to plant, did they look just
as when you put them in the water? No. They
were swollen with the water, and the skin was
wrinkled. You could see the seam around the
bean, and the eye, much plainer than when the
bean was dry.</p>

<p>In a day or two you may dig up one bean from the
edge of the pot. Now you will see a small round
thing, shaped a little like your lead-pencil point,
coming out of the eye of the bean.</p>

<p>Take a needle and gently split the bean open. The
upper end of this tiny stem is bent over, and has
a little wrinkled knob on it.</p>

<p>In another day you may dig up a second bean. Split it;
you will see quite plainly that the wrinkled knob
is a pair of leaves, and the round object is a stem.</p>

<p>Wait a day or two more and dig up the third bean.
The stem is putting out wee roots. The leaves
have come out of the bean and are trying to get
to the top of the earth. The two thick halves of
your bean are held, by little thread-like stems, to
the main stalk of the new plant. The skin that
was on the bean is now a small dry husk.</p>

<p>In a few days your fourth bean will be well above
ground. You will notice that the two thick
halves of the bean you planted are now turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
green, and look like thick leaves. At first they
lay side by side. The skin was like a little cap
over the ends of the two.</p>

<p>Perhaps in that state the bean made you think of a
new chick just out of the shell, with a piece of
the shell still on its head. Did you ever see that?
Soon the bit of husk falls away. Then these two
parts of the bean spread from each other. One is
on one side the stem, one on the other.</p>

<p>They look like leaves. We call them “the seed-leaves.”
You will see that as the plant grows,
these shrink up. That is because the young plant
is feeding on them. The thick part of the bean
is the plant’s first food.</p>

<p>The bean which you put in the middle of the pot has
gone through all these changes. Its two little
wrinkled leaves become greener and larger. Now
they show their deep green color, and are of a
heart shape. They have long stems. Between
these stems is a little bud, or growing-point. It
shoots up and puts out more leaves.</p>

<p>By this time the thick seed-leaves are quite shrunk up
and dead. Dig up that fifth bean, the last one on
the side of the pot. Can you tell why the seed-leaves
are dead? The plant has eaten up all the
food in them. And now it has a strong root of
fibres, and can take its own food from the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>If you look near the roots of trees in the wood or garden,
you will, no doubt, find oaks, cherries, maples,
other little trees, in all these stages of growth.</p>

<p>Your last bean-plant grows fast. It is tall and slim.
It needs a stick to climb on. Notice how the stem
winds around the stick. See, the new leaves are
pale and smooth. As they grow, they become
darker and have hairs on them.</p>

<p>Break off a bit of stem and leaf. There is juice in
them. That is sap. It runs all through the plant
in little pipes or tubes. It carries in it the mineral
food the root-mouths suck from the earth.</p>

<p>By and by you will see a new thing in among the
leaves. It is a bud, but not a leaf-bud. It is
shorter and thicker than the leaf-buds, and it is
twisted. As it grows, its green cover opens, and
you see a little white, red, or purple color.</p>

<p>This is the flower-bud. Slowly the colored petals
unroll. If you have several flowers on your vine,
you can take one to pieces, to look at all the
flower parts. The seed-bag at the bottom of the
pistil will be so small that you will not notice it.</p>

<p>As the flowers grow older and seem to fade a little, cut
off one more to look at. Now you see the seed-pod
growing at the bottom of the pistil. The
pistil is made of three parts; the seed-bag, the
stem or post, and a little cushion at the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Now your pretty bean-flower has faded, and fallen
away, dead. But what is this where the flower
was? A little sharp, green thing is here! Why,
it is a tiny bean-pod! Every day it grows larger.
You can see the little beans through the skin of
the pod.</p>

<p>By and by the pod has its full growth. It is brown
and hard and dry. It will crack open easily. It
cracks all around into two halves. Here are the
beans fastened to the sides of the pod, by little
thread-like stems. Just such beans as you planted
in the spring!</p>

<p>All the spring and the summer your bean-plant grew.
Now it is done growing. The cold autumn has
come. The seed is ripe.</p>

<p>But what is the matter with your bean-plant? It is
turning hard and brown and dry. It is dead. It
will do no good to water it. Its roots drink no
more; they are dead. It was made to grow only
from spring to fall. From seed to seed, that is
its story; that is what it was made for.</p>

<p>Here, folded up in these hard dry beans lie the bean-vines
of next year. These new beans will have, if
you plant them, such a life-story as this that we
have been reading.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE GROWTH OF PLANTS.</p>


<p>How do plants grow?
That is a very great
question, but we will
try to find a little
part of the answer.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="i_032" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">IN SUN AND DEW.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You know when you look
at a flower, as a lily,
you find in the middle
of it some tall,
slender parts which
you are told are stamens
and a pistil.
The pistil usually
stands right in the
centre of the flower.
It seems to be the
most precious part,
and all the other
parts take care of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>I knew a boy who told his sister that “they said at
school that plants had little guns.” He thought
the word pistil meant something to shoot with!
But if there is any shooting done by plants, it is
done by the stamens, and not by the pistil.</p>

<p>On the top of the stamen is a little box, to hold the
pollen, or flower-dust. You read of that some time
ago in the lesson about bees and ants, in your
other Nature Readers.</p>

<p>When the pollen is of full size, or ripe, the little box
bursts open, and out the pollen flies. The growth
of the plant begins here, with the pollen.</p>

<p>A tiny grain of pollen, falling on the top of the pistil,
begins to grow. It puts out little threads like
roots. These grow down the stem, or post, of the
pistil into the seed case. There they find the seed
germs, and when the pollen comes to them, the
germs begin to grow. They grow very fast.</p>

<p>It is then that the pretty flowers fade. The work of
the blossom is done when the pollen is ripe, and
the seed germs begin to grow.</p>

<p>But while the blossom dies, the seed bag grows larger
and larger. As the seeds ripen, the bag, or case,
that holds them becomes brittle. It will break
easily. Often this pod, or seed bag, bursts open
when the seeds are ripe. Then the seeds fly all
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>They fall upon the ground. There with the wind and
rain and the slight change of the top soil, they
slowly sink into the dirt. They keep moist and
warm until spring. Then they sprout out as you
see the beans do.</p>

<p>Some seeds will die if left to lie all winter in the
ground. We say such seeds are not hardy. They
are seeds that are not native to the place where
they grow. Seeds are hardy in their native
places.</p>

<p>Now you have seen how the seed germ grows to be a
ripe seed. You have seen how the ripe seed sprouts
into a plant. You know that plants grow. They
increase in size. They put out more leaves. They
have flowers and seeds. How is this done? It
cannot all be explained, but a little of it can be.</p>

<p>Look at yourself. You grow. Suppose you did not
eat? Would you grow? If you stop eating you
will shrink up, and be thin, and even die. Have
you never heard people say that if children do not
have enough to eat, they will be small and not
grow well?</p>

<p>You grow by eating. So does the plant. But mind
you, when we speak of the plant as eating, we
mean really <i>drinking</i>. The food the plant takes
from the earth must come to it in a liquid form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>You know of some insects which take their food by
sucking the juice out of things.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> So the plants
get their mineral food, held in water. They suck
the water out of the ground, by the wee mouths at
the tips of the root fibres.</p>

<p>You know, when it is very dry the plants droop. People
say “it is so dry that the crops will not grow.”
Even the leaves of the trees die and fall off in a
very dry time. They die for lack of food-drink.</p>

<p>You have a stomach where the food that you get is
so changed that it will make for you good blood.
The blood feeds and builds up every part of your
body. The plant has no stomach, but its leaves
serve it for the same purpose.</p>

<p>In the leaves the plant food is turned into stuff like the
plant. But how does the food pass into the
leaves? See the tall tree! How does the plant
food go from the roots to the top-most leaves? It
runs up little pipes or cells.</p>

<p>Plant stems are made of bundles of these tiny pipes.
Do you now fancy long slim pipes, as long as the
stem or trunk of a tree? Dear me, no! These
tubes are very short.</p>

<p>But the bundles of them are laid along, all up the stem.
They are laid end to end. Or you may call it one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
long tube, with little walls, or partitions across.
How does the sap pass through these walls? It
would be very hard to tell.</p>

<p>What we know is, that it does go through very quickly.
Take a flower with a clear green stem. Put it
into a glass of water in which is some red or blue
color. You can watch the rise of the colored
water by the change in the color of the stem.</p>

<p>Take, in your garden or flower-pot, a plant that is dry
and drooping. Pour water on it. Soak the earth
about it well. In a very little time you will see
the plant revive. The leaves will look fresh. The
flowers will hold up their drooping heads.</p>

<p>I have seen a plant quite changed in this way, in half
an hour. So you see, in this little time the roots
drank the water from the earth. The water, as
sap, ran up all the pipes, through all the partition
walls. The flower was fed in every part.</p>

<p>When the plant is young and tender, it takes in much
of its food through the whole surface or skin. It
drinks in air, rain, and dew, through its skin. But
as the plant gets older, and harder, it feeds more
and more by the new roots and young leaves. At
last, it takes almost all its food by the root and
new leaves. I shall soon tell you what leaves eat.</p>

<p>Why then does any plant or tree look so much better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
for a good washing? One reason is that the dust
is washed off. Then the pores, or little holes in the
skin, are free and open. The plant can breathe
through all its skin.</p>

<p>Do not forget that. Your skin is also full of little
pores. They need to be kept open by plenty of
washing.</p>

<p>Let us go back to those little root-mouths. When they
drink water, they get some solid stuff. Every
drop of water has a mite of mineral in it. It is
this solid matter that makes plant fibre. It is this
that is left as ashes when you burn a plant, or
bit of wood.</p>

<p>The juice of plants is called <i>sap</i>. When the root drinks
the water from the earth, it travels up through
the pipes, through all the cell-wells. So it soon
reaches the leaves. What do the leaves do with
it?</p>

<p>The leaves, having a wide surface, spread out the sap
to the light and air. The heat of the sun cooks
the sap. That is, it sets free, in a sort of steam,
the clear water. The solid parts of the sap are
left.</p>

<p>You know that things are made thicker by cooking.
Does not the molasses become thicker when you
cook it for candy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>When the sap is made thicker it is like glue. But it is
still very thin glue. Also the light and air and
heat change the sap in other ways of which I cannot
now tell you.</p>

<p>But the sap, being changed in the leaf, is now true
plant stuff. It must travel through the plant to
build it up.</p>

<p>It is only in the green parts of the plant that the sap
is changed to true plant material. What was at
first mineral, held in water and air, is now vegetable,
or plant matter. Now you see why a plant
must have air and light, or it will not grow.</p>

<p>Now that it is fit for plant food, the sap sets out to run
through all the plant. It must go to every part
to build all up.</p>

<p>There are not two sets of tubes, one for raw and one for
cooked sap. All must run through the same cells.
So you see, the sap will be mixed. The raw sap
going up has some food sap in it. The food sap
runs about with some raw sap mixed with it.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, each kind reaches the right place. All
the raw sap is cooked, all the food sap builds the
plant. Here it builds root, there leaf, there stem,
there flower, or seed.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice how fast a plant will grow?
Choose out some flower or weed. Watch it. See<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
how the tiny stem becomes tall and stout. See
how the little leaves grow large and thick. A
sunflower is a fine plant to watch in this way.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FOOD OF PLANTS.</p>


<p>You saw how in the bean a deal of food had been
stored up for the young plant. So in the tuber of
the potato, and the seed of corn, food is stored up.
This food is stored up so that the young plant can
grow in the dark, before it gets to air and light.
Also it can grow before its root-mouths are able
to drink for it.</p>

<p>The food so stored up is mostly starch. It is much
such starch as your mother uses for the clothes.</p>

<p>Starch so laid up in the plant can turn sweet and
change to sugar. The beet root has much sugar
in it. A pea has sugar in it. So has corn. In
the sugar-cane there is so much sugar that the
cane tastes very sweet when you chew it. The
sap of one kind of maple tree has much sugar in
it. Did you ever boil down maple sap to sugar?</p>

<p>In some thick plants, like the cactus, much food stuff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
stays in the stems. Usually it goes to all parts of
the plant. The leaves, as the thinnest parts, keep
the least. In the beet, carrot, potato, and others,
much food is stored in what we call the root.
This becomes a cellar or pantry, full of laid-up
food.</p>

<p>As the food goes about the plant to build it, the little
pipes or cells growing larger divide off into other
cells. They set up new walls. The plant becomes
larger as its cells increase. We will not try to explain
this further to you. You might think it dull.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to know what it is that the
plant drinks out of the soil?</p>

<p>The dirt—as you call the “top-crust” of the earth—is
made partly of mineral matter. Men and animals
cannot eat mineral matter. But the sap
carries this to the leaves. It is not in a solid but
in a liquid form. Every leaf is a little kitchen
where, with the sun for a fire, the earthy stuff
is cooked and changed into vegetables.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Now they are good food for animals. The minerals
carried in grass and clover are eaten by the ox
and the cow, and so are turned into good beef
and milk. The wheat is partly made of mineral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
substances changed to plant stuff. Wheat is
made into bread. The bread feeds boys and girls.</p>

<p>So the beef and butter that were grass and, before
that earthy matter, and the wheat that was once
partly mineral, turns at last into rosy flesh and
blood for you who read this lesson. Well! Well!
There are many wonders in this world!</p>

<p>If all plants liked and used the same food, our food
would be too much of one kind. But as plants
eat many kinds of minerals, through them we
receive material to build all parts of our bodies.
We need lime for our bones. We need sugar.
We need salt in our bodies. Plants eat from the
soil lime, salt, chalk, iron, and many other minerals.</p>

<p>Suppose you go into the country. Why, here is corn
in this field! Last year clover was here! You
say to the farmer: “Why do you change things in
this way? Why does not your wheat grow where
it grew last year?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says the farmer, “my crops will not grow every
year in the same place. Next year I shall have
this cornfield put down in grass for a while.”</p>

<p>“But why, why, Mr. Farmer? Why not have the grass-field
always the grass-field? Why not have the
wheat-field always in wheat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“It is because each plant has some chief kind of mineral
food that it needs most. It takes more of
that kind out of the ground. After a time it eats
up all of that sort of mineral that is within reach
of its roots in one field. Then the crop must be
grown in a new place, out of which the mineral
has not been eaten.</p>

<p>“By and by the sun, rain, frost, acting on the ground,
bring up more of the kind of mineral that was
used. In the meantime some other plant that
needs more of something else will grow in that
field.</p>

<p>“So, after a time, the wheat, or corn, can be planted in
its old field again. But if crops grow year after
year in the same field they will be sickly for lack
of food.</p>

<p>“New, rich earth that has never been tilled, will feed
the same crops many years.”</p>

<p>While we are in the country, let us look around at what
the farmer does. Here he brings cart-loads of
stuff from the stables. He scatters it over his
fields. Here he brings barrels of a kind of dust.
He puts that too over the ground.</p>

<p>“O, Mr. Farmer, what are you doing now?”</p>

<p>“I am putting food on the ground for my crops.” The
plants have eaten much of the food from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
earth. These things contain more of the same
kind of food.</p>

<p>Men have studied plants until they know what each
kind needs to eat. They put this kind of food on
the ground and it is carried to the plant by means
of water.</p>

<p>What are these things that the farmer puts on his
field? Bones are ground into bone dust. Fish
are also ground into a powder or dust. Shells and
sea-weeds and lime are scattered over the ground.
Dead horses and other animals buried in what is
called a muck heap, until they are decayed and
fall into pieces, are among the material that the
farmer brings to enrich the soil.</p>

<p>Do you not see that all this food would be of no use
to the plant were it not for the green leaves?
The green leaves turn the raw sap into food for
plants and men.</p>

<p>The green leaves also take other things from the air
and build them up into plant stuff. Our breath,
the smoke from our fires, become food for plants,
and so food for men. I shall tell you of this in
another lesson.</p>

<p>Thus you see the green leaves are the stomach of the
plant. In them all the food is made of use.</p>

</figure>

<p>The seed is the egg of the plant. Just as the new
chick is in the egg of the hen, or the new wasp is
in the egg of the wasp, the new plant is in the
seed.</p>

<p>Let us look at a hen’s egg. It has a shell. Inside the
shell is the clear white. Inside the white is the
yellow ball, or yolk. The shell keeps the white
and yolk safe. The white and yolk of the egg
make the food by which the chick lives and grows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
before it is hatched. In the yolk you may see a
tiny spot, which is the germ out of which the
young chick will grow.</p>

<p>The eggs of all birds and insects vary little from this
plan. The flower-seed is also an egg made on this
same pattern.</p>

<p>The skin you saw on the bean serves for the shell.
There is an inner skin often, like the silken skin
inside the egg-shell. The food stored up in the
seed-leaves serves as the yolk and white of the
egg. The tiny germ between answers to the spot
in the yolk, which is the chick germ.</p>

<p>The seeds of flowers differ more than the eggs of birds
and insects. For some seeds have no coats at all.
Some have only one. But in this lesson we speak
of seeds as they commonly are. We tell you of
seeds as you are likely to see them. The rarer
things you must learn in larger books.</p>

<p>Let us look at seeds a little. Think how they differ in
size. A great cocoanut is a very huge seed. If
you ask your mother to show you her garden-seeds,
you will find some as small as the finest
grains of dust.</p>

<p>Seeds vary in color. Did any one ever give you a little
round, bright India bean? It was red as a drop
of blood. It had a jet black mark on one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>If you look in the grocer’s window, you will see yellow
peas and green ones. You will see beans,—black,
white, brown, yellow, purple, and spotted. Some
of the garden-seeds are purple. Some look like
the filings of steel, or silver, or gold.</p>

<p>Seeds vary in shape. You know how acorns and chestnuts
look; they are seeds. Cherry-pits—stones,
you call them, they are so hard—are round. A
melon-seed is flat. Some seeds are three-cornered.
Some have lines and dots as if they were carved.</p>

<p>Some seeds have little hooks on them to hold them to
the ground so that they may not blow away.
Other seeds use these hooks to catch upon things,
that will carry them from place to place.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a thistle or dandelion seed go sailing
through the air? It looks like a little silver ship,
or balloon. It has a fine little feather on it to
keep it up. The reason why thistles and dandelions
grow far and wide is, that their seeds are
carried about on the breeze.</p>

<p>If you live in town, go and look at the seeds in the
seed-man’s window. If you live in the country,
suppose you collect all the seeds you can.</p>

<p>Did you ever think in how many ways seeds are kept
from harm? What is a melon, or a pumpkin, but
a big seed box?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” you say, “melons and pumpkins are good to
eat!” So they are, the better luck for us, that is.
But all the plant wants of these big things, is to
hold the precious seed.</p>

<p>An apple is a nice fleshy case to hold the seeds in the
core. The cherry and plum are softer seed bags,
which hold hard pits.</p>

<p>Did you ever look at a blackberry? You saw it was
made up of little balls or knobs. Each of these
soft, sweet knobs holds a tiny seed. A strawberry
is quite different. The strawberry is a sweet
red cone. Look, it is sprinkled all over with little
yellow dots! Each of these dots is a seed.</p>

<p>I will tell you a little about the “why” of all this, in
some other lesson.</p>

<p>You see the seed is that without which the plant cannot
make a new plant. Without seeds there would
soon be no more plants.</p>

<p>The leaves are those parts without which the plant
cannot live and grow. But I think I hear some
sharp child say, “How about those plants that
have no leaves?”</p>

<p>In the few plants that have no leaves, the stem may
help to serve in their place. But most of the few
plants that have no leaves fasten upon other
plants, and grow upon them. They use the leaves
of those other plants to do their work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>In these simple lessons, I tell you of only common
things. I speak of the things that you can see
each day. For the rare things you must go to
larger books.</p>

<p>You know from your last lessons that leaves are the
stomach of the plant. Leaves are also the plant’s
lungs.</p>

<p>Plants must breathe. They must breathe in and out,
as you do. Also the plants must get rid of the
water which they do not need after they have
taken the food out of it. Much of this water
passes out through the leaves.</p>

<p>You know when you are very warm, you feel a moisture
come on your skin. That was once water in
your blood. It creeps out through tiny pores over
all your skin.</p>

<p>The plant skin has such pores. The water goes off
through them. When the plant breathes out this
water, then more hurries up through the cells to
take its place. So the sap keeps running up and
down all the time.</p>

<p>Plants not only send out water through the pores of
the leaves, but also a kind of air or gas. If they
did not do that, we should soon all be dead. Can
I make that plain to you?</p>

<p>Did you ever hear your mother say, “The air here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
bad or close”? Did you ever see your teacher
open a door or a window, to “<i>air</i>” the schoolroom?
If you ask why, you will be told “So
many people breathing here make the air bad.”</p>

<p>How does our breathing make the air bad? When our
blood runs through our bodies it takes up little
bits of matter that our bodies are done with.
This stuff makes the blood dark and thick. But
soon the blood comes around to our lungs.</p>

<p>Now as we breathe <i>out</i>, we send into the air the tiny
atoms of this waste stuff. It is carbonic acid
gas. As we breathe <i>in</i>, we take from the fresh
air a gas called oxygen. That goes to our lungs,
and lo! it makes the blood fresh and clean, and
red once more.</p>

<p>So you can see, that when many people breathe in one
room they will use up all the good clean air. At
the same time they will load the air of the room
with the gas they breathe out.</p>

<p>That is why the window is opened. We wish to sweep
away the bad air, and let in good air.</p>

<p>But at this rate, as all men and other animals breathe
out carbonic acid gas, why does not all the air in
the world get bad? Why, when they all use
oxygen, do they not use up all the oxygen that
is in the world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Just here the plants come in to help. Carbonic acid
gas is bad for men, it is food to plants. Oxygen
is needed by animals, but plants want to get rid
of it. Animals breathe out a form of carbon and
breathe in oxygen. Plants do just the other
thing. They breathe out oxygen and take in
carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>The air, loaded with this, comes to the plant. At
once all the little leaf-mouths are wide open to
snatch out of the air the carbonic acid gas.
And, as the plants are very honest little things,
they give where they take away. They take
carbon from the air, and breathe into the air a
little oxygen.</p>

<p>Where did they get that? The air they breathe has
both carbon and oxygen in it. So they keep what
they want,—that is, carbon,—and send out the
oxygen.</p>

<p>Now it is only the green part of the plant that does
this fine work for us. It is the green parts, chiefly
the leaves, that send out good oxygen for us to
breathe. It is the green leaf that snatches from
the air those gases which would hurt us.</p>

<p>It is the green leaf that changes the harmful form of
carbon into good plant stuff, which is fit for our
food. How does it do that? Let us see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>What makes a leaf green? Bobby who crushed a leaf
to see, told me “a leaf was full of green paint.”</p>

<p>Inside the green leaves is a kind of green paste, or
jelly. Now it is this “leaf-green” that does all
the work. The “leaf-green” eats up carbon. The
“leaf-green” turns carbon into nice safe plant
material. It is “leaf-green” that sets free good
oxygen for us.</p>

<p>“Leaf-green” is a good fairy, living in every little cell in
the leaf. Leaf-green is a fairy which works only
in the day-time. Leaf-green likes the sun. Leaf-green
will not work in the dark, but goes to bed
and goes to sleep!</p>

<p>In such simple lessons as these, I can tell you only
a little of what <i>is</i>. The deep “how” and “why”
of things I cannot explain. Even the very wisest
men do not know all the how and the why of the
“leaf-green” fairy.</p>

<p>I have told you these few things that you may have
wonders to think of when you see green leaves.
After this lesson, will you not care more for seeds
and leaves than you ever did before?</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE COLOR OF PLANTS.</p>


<p>Almost the first thing that you will notice about a
plant is its color. The little child, before it can
speak, will hold out its hands for a bright red rose,
or a golden lily. I think the color is one of the
most wonderful things about a plant.</p>

<p>Come into the field. Here you see a yellow buttercup,
growing near a white daisy. Beside them is a red
rose. Close by, blooms a great purple flower. All
grow out of the same earth, and breathe the same
air. Yet how they differ in color.</p>

<p>Some flowers have two or three colors upon each petal.
Have you not seen the tulip with its striped blossoms,
and the petunias spotted with white and red?</p>

<p>The flower of the cotton plant changes in color. Within
a few days this flower appears in three distinct
hues. The chicory blossom changes from blue to
nearly white as the day grows warm.</p>

<p>Look at your mother’s roses. Some are white, others
are red, pink, or yellow. None are ever blue.</p>

<p>Then look at a wild-rose tree. The root and stem are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
brown. The green color is in the leaves, and in
some of the stems. The petals are red. The
stamens and pistils are yellow.</p>

<p>You never saw the red color get astray and run into
the leaves. The leaf-green did not lose itself, and
travel up to the petals. The stamens and pistils
did not turn brown instead of golden.</p>

<p>Does not that seem a wonder, now that you think of
it? Perhaps you never noticed it before. It is
one thing to see things, and another to notice
them so that you think about them.</p>

<p>Here is another fact about color in plants. All summer
you see that the leaves are green. In the
autumn they begin to change. You wake up some
fine frosty morning and the tree leaves are all
turned red, yellow, brown, or purple. It is a fine
sight.</p>

<p>It is the going away of the leaf-green from the leaf
that begins the change of leaf-color in the fall.
The leaves have done growing. Their stems are
hard and woody. They do not breathe as freely
as they did. The sap does not run through them
as it did early in the season.</p>

<p>The leaf-green shrinks up in the cells. Or, it goes off
to some other part of the plant. Sometimes part
of it is destroyed. Then the leaves begin to
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes a red sap runs into the leaf cells. Or, an
oily matter goes there, in place of the “leaf-green.”</p>

<p>The leaf-green changes color if it gets too much
oxygen. In the autumn the plant does not throw
out so much oxygen. What it keeps turns the
leaf-green from green to red, yellow, or brown.</p>

<p>The bright color in plants is not in the flower alone.
You have seen that roots and seeds have quite
as bright colors as blossoms. What flowers are
brighter than many fruits are?</p>

<p>The cherry is crimson, or pink, or nearly black. What
a fine yellow, red, purple, we find in plums! Is
there any yellow brighter than that of the Indian
corn? Is there a red gayer than you find on the
apples you like so well? What is more golden
than a heap of oranges?</p>

<p>If you wish to find splendid color in a part of a plant,
look at a water-melon. The skin is green marked
with pale green, or white. Next, inside, is a rind
of pale greenish white. Then comes a soft, juicy,
crimson mass. In that are jet black seeds.</p>

<p>Oh, where does all this color come from? Why is it
always just in the right place? The melon rind
does not take the black tint that belongs to the
seeds. The skin does not put on the crimson of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the pulp. See, too, how this color comes slowly,
as the melon ripens. At first the skin is of the
same dark green as the leaves, and inside all is
of a greenish white.</p>

<p>Let us try to find out where all this color comes from.
Do you know we ourselves can make changes in
the color of flowers? Take one of those big
hydrangeas. It has a pink flower. But give it
very rich black earth to grow in. Mix some alum
and iron with the earth. Water it with strong
bluing water. Lay soot and coal-dust upon the
earth it grows in. Very soon your hydrangea
will have blue flowers, instead of pink ones.</p>

<p>Once I had a petunia with large flowers of a dirty
white color. I fed it with soot and coal-dust. I
watered it with strong bluing water. After a few
weeks my petunia had red or crimson flowers.
Some of the flowers were of a very deep red.
Others were spotted with red and white.</p>

<p>Now from this you may guess that the plant obtains
much of its color from what it feeds on in the
soil.</p>

<p>But you may give the plant very good soil, and yet if
you make it grow in the dark, it will have almost
no color. If it lives at all, even the green leaves
will be pale and sickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>This will show you that the light must act in some way
on what the plant eats, to make the fine color.</p>

<p>The plant, you know, eats minerals from the earth. In
its food it gets little grains of coloring stuff.</p>

<p>But how the color goes to the right place we cannot
tell. We cannot tell why it is, that from the
same earth, in the same light, there will be flowers
of many colors. We cannot tell why flowers on
the same plant, or parts of the same flower, will
have different colors. That is one of the secrets
and wonders that no one has found out.</p>

<p>There are many plants which store up coloring matter,
just as plants store up starch, or sugar. The
indigo, which makes our best blue dye, comes
from a plant. Ask your mother to show you some
indigo. When the plant is soaked in water the
coloring stuff sinks to the bottom of the water,
like a blue dust.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice the fine red sumac? That gives a
deep yellow dye. The saffron plant is full of a
bright orange color. Other plants give other dyes.</p>

<p>Sometimes children take the bright petals of plants,
or stems, that have bright color in them, to paint
with. Did you ever do that? You can first draw
a picture, and then color it, by rubbing on it the
colored parts of plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Some trees and plants, from which dyes are made, have
the coloring stuff in the bark or wood. That is
the way with the logwood tree. The best black
dye is made from that.</p>

<p>You have seen how much dark red juice you can find
in berries. Did you ever squeeze out the red juice
of poke or elder berries? It is like red ink. Did
you ever notice how strawberries stain your fingers
red? Grapes and blackberries make your lips and
tongue purple.</p>

<p>No doubt you have often had your hands stained brown,
for days, from the husks of walnuts. All these
facts will show you what a deal of color is taken
up from the soil by plants, changed by the sun,
and stored up in their different parts.</p>

<p>But the chief of all color in the plant is the leaf-green.
We cannot make a dye out of that.</p>

<p>Leaf-green is the color of which there is the most. It
is the color which suits the eye best of all. How
tired we should be of crimson or orange grass!</p>

<p>Though leaves and stems are generally green, there are
some plants which have stems of a bright red or
yellow color. Yellow is the common color for stamens
and pistils. In some plants, as the tulip, the
peach, and others, the stamens are of a deep red-brown,
or crimson, or pink, or even black color.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE MOTION OF PLANTS.</p>


<p>If I ask you what motion plants have, I think you
will tell me that they have a motion upward.
You will say that they “grow up.” You will
not say that they move in the wind. You know
that that is not the kind of motion which I
mean.</p>

<p>Some plants grow more by day, some by night. On
the whole, there is more growing done by day
than by night. At night it is darker, cooler, and
there is more moisture in the air. The day has
more heat, light, and dryness. For these causes
growth varies by day and by night.</p>

<p>Warmth and moisture are the two great aids to the
growth of plants. Heat, light, and wet have
most to do with the motion of plants. For the
motion of plants comes chiefly from growth.</p>

<p>The parts of the plant the motion of which we shall
notice, are, the stems, leaves, tendrils, and petals.
Perhaps you have seen the motion of a plant stem
toward the sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Did you ever notice in house plants, that the leaves
and branches turn to the place from which light
comes to them? Did you ever hear your mother
say that she must turn the window plants around,
so that they would not grow “one-sided”?</p>

<p>Did you ever take a pot plant that had grown all
toward one side, and turn it around, and then
notice it? In two or three weeks you would find
the leaves, stems, branches, bent quite the other
way. First they lifted up straight. Then they
slowly bent around to the light.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have noticed that many flower stems stoop
to the east in the morning. Then they move
slowly around. At evening you find them bending
toward the west.</p>

<p>This is one motion of stems. Another motion is that
of long, weak stems, such as those of the grape-vine
or morning-glory. They will climb about a
tree or stick.</p>

<p>Such vines do much of their climbing by curling around
the thing which supports them. If you go into
the garden, and look at a bean-vine, you will see
what fine twists and curves it makes about the
beanpole.</p>

<p>Such twists or curves can be seen yet more plainly in
a tendril. A tendril is a little string-like part of
the plant, which serves it for hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes tendrils grow out of the tips of the leaves.</p>

<p>Sometimes they grow from the stem. Sometimes they
grow from the end of a leaf-stem in place of a
final leaf.</p>

<p>Tendrils, as I told you before, are twigs, leaves, buds,
or other parts of a plant, changed into little, long
clasping hands.</p>

<p>Now and then the long slender stem of a leaf acts as
a tendril. It twists once around the support
which holds up the vine. Thus it ties the stem
of the vine to the support.</p>

<p>You have seen not only climbing plants, such as the
grape-vine. You have seen also creeping plants,
as the strawberry and ground-ivy. You will tell
me that a climbing plant is one which travels <i>up</i>
something. You will say, also, that a creeping
plant is a vine which runs along the ground.</p>

<p>The climbing plant helps itself along by tendrils. The
creeping plant has little new roots to hold it firm.</p>

<p>Look at the strawberry beds. Do you see some long
sprays which seem to tie plant to plant? Your
father will tell you that they are “runners.”</p>

<p>The plant throws out one of these runners. Then at
the end of the runner a little root starts out, and
fastens it to the ground. A runner is very like
a tendril. There are never any leaves upon it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
But the end of a tendril never puts out a bud. The
end of the runner, where it roots, puts out a bud.</p>

<p>This bud grows into a new plant. The new plant
sends out its runners. These root again, and so
on. Thus, you see, a few strawberry plants will
soon cover a large space of ground.</p>

<p>There is a very pretty little fern, called the “walking
fern,” which has an odd way of creeping about.
When the slender fronds<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> reach their full length,
some of the tallest ones bend over to the earth.
The tip of the frond touches the ground. From
that tip come little root-like fibres, and fix themselves
in the earth. A new plant springs up from
them.</p>

<p>When the new plant is grown, a frond of that bends
over and takes root again. So it goes on. Soon
there is a large, soft, thick mat of walking fern
upon the ground.</p>

<p>This putting out new roots to go on by is also the
fashion of some climbing plants. Did you ever
notice how the ivy will root all along a wall?
Little strong roots put out at the joints of the
stem, and hold the plant fast.</p>

<p>All this motion in plants is due to growth. In very
hot lands where there is not only much heat, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
where long, wet seasons fill the earth with water,
the growth of plants is very rapid.</p>

<p>In these hot lands, there are more climbing plants than
in cool lands. Some trees, which, in cool lands
where they grow slowly, never climb, turn to
climbers in hot lands.</p>

<p>Some plants will twine and climb in hot weather, and
stand up straight alone in cool weather. This
shows that in hot weather they grow so fast that
they cannot hold themselves up. When it is
cool, they grow slowly, and make more strong
fibre. But we must leave the stem motions of
plants and speak of the motion of other parts.</p>

<p>Let me tell you how to try the leaf motion of plants.
Take a house plant to try, as that is where wind
will not move the leaf. Get a piece of glass about
four or five inches square. Smoke it very black.</p>

<p>Lay it under the leaf, so that the point of the leaf bent
down will be half an inch from the glass.</p>

<p>Then take a bristle from a brush and put it in the tip
of the leaf. Run the bristle in the leaf so that
the end will come beyond the leaf, and just touch
the glass. Leave it a night and a day. Then
you will find the story of the leaf’s travels written
on the glass. As the leaf moves, the bristle will
write little lines in the black on the glass. Try it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>As you have proved the motion of the leaf with your
smoked glass, let us look at leaf motion. There
is, first, that motion which unfolds or unrolls the
leaf from the bud. That is made because, by feeding,
the plant is growing larger, and the leaf needs
more room.</p>

<p>The leaf often has, after it is grown, a motion of opening
and shutting. Other leaves have a motion of
rising and falling. But of these motions I will
tell you in another lesson.</p>

<p>Flowers have, first, the motion by which the flower-bud
unfolds to the full, open blossom. That, as
the leaf-bud motion, comes from growing. Did
you ever watch a rose-bud, or a lily-bud, unfold?</p>

<p>Then the flowers of many plants have a motion of
opening and shutting each day. I shall tell you
of that, also, in another lesson.</p>

<p>Besides these motions in plants, there are others. Did
you ever see how a plant will turn, or bend, to
grow away from a stone, or something, that is in
its way?</p>

<p>If you watch with care the root of one of your bean-seeds,
you will see that it grows in little curves, now
this way, now that. It grows so, even when it
grows in water, or in air, where nothing touches it.</p>

<p>People who study these changes tell us that the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
plant, as it grows, has a turning motion. In this
motion all the plant, and all its parts, move
around as they grow.</p>

<p>The curious reasons for this motion of plants, you must
learn when you are older. I can now tell you
only a little about it. I will tell you that the
plant moves, because the little cells in it grow in
a one-sided way.</p>

<p>Thus the air, light, heat, moisture, cause the cells on
one side of the plant to grow larger than the
others. Then the plant stoops, or is pulled over,
that way. It is bent over by the weight. Then
that side is hidden, and the other side has more
light, heat, and wet. And as the cells grow, it
stoops that way.</p>

<p>This is easy to understand in climbing plants. Their
long, slim stems are weak. They bend with their
own weight. They bend to the side that is slightly
heavier. Their motion then serves to find them
a support. As they sweep around, they touch
something which will hold them up. Then they
cling to it.</p>

<p>Now, there is another reason for a tendril taking hold
of anything. The skin of the tendril is very soft
and fine. As it lies against a string, or stick, or
branch, the touch of this object on its fine skin
makes the tendril bend, or curl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>It keeps on bending or curling, until it gets quite
around the object which it touches. Then it still
goes on bending, and so it gets around a second
time, and a third, and so on. Thus the tendril
makes curl after curl, as closely and evenly as you
could wind a string on a stick.</p>

<p>Some plants, as the hop, move around with the sun;
other plants move in just the other direction. It
is as if some turned their faces, and some their
backs, to the sun.</p>

<p class="ph3">PLANTS AND THEIR PARTNERS.</p>


<p>Did I not tell you that the plants had taken partners
and gone into business? I said that their business
was seed-growing, but that the result of the
business was to feed and clothe the world.</p>

<p>In our first lessons we showed you that we get all our
food, clothes, light, and fuel, first or last, from
plants. “Stop! stop!” you say. “Some of us
burn coal. Coal is a mineral.” Yes, coal is a
mineral now, but it began by being a vegetable.
All the coal-beds were once forests of trees and
ferns. Ask your teacher to tell you about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp55" id="i_066" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE THREE PARTNERS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If all these things which we
need come from plants,
we may be very glad
that the plants have
gone into business to
make more plants.</p>

<p>Who are these partners
which we told you
plants have? They are
the birds and the insects.
They might have
a sign up, you see,
“Plant, Insect &amp; Co.,
General Providers for
Men.”</p>

<p>Do let us get at the truth of
this matter at once!
Do you remember what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
you read about the stamens and pistils which stand
in the middle of the flower? You know the stamens
carry little boxes full of pollen. The bottom
of the pistil is a little case, or box, full of
seed germs.</p>

<p>You know also that the pollen must creep down through
the pistils, and touch the seed germs before they
can grow to be seeds. And you also know, that
unless there are new seeds each year the world of
plants would soon come to an end.</p>

<p>Now you see from all this that the stamens and pistils
are the chief parts of the flower. The flower can
give up its calyx, or cup, and its gay petals, its color,
honey, and perfume. If it keeps its stamens and
pistils, it will still be a true seed-bearing flower.</p>

<p>It is now plain that the aim of the flower must be to
get that pollen-dust safely landed on the top of
the pistil.</p>

<p>You look at a lily, and you say, “Oh! that is very easy.
Just let those pollen boxes fly open, and their dust
is sure to hit the pistil, all right.”</p>

<p>But not so fast! Let me tell you that many plants do
not carry the stamens and pistils all in one flower.
The stamens, with the pollen boxes, may be in
one flower, and the pistil, with its sticky cushion
to catch pollen, may be in another flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>More than that, these flowers, some with stamens, and
some with pistils, may not even be all on one
plant! Have you ever seen a poplar-tree? The
poplar has its stamen-flowers on one tree, and its
pistil-flowers on another. The palm-tree is in the
same case.</p>

<p>Now this affair of stamen and pistil and seed making
does not seem quite so easy, does it? And here
is still another fact. Seeds are the best and
strongest, and most likely to produce good plants,
if the pollen comes to the pistil, from a flower not
on the same plant.</p>

<p>This is true even of such plants as the lily, the tulip,
and the columbine, where stamens and pistils
grow in one flower.</p>

<p>Now you see quite plainly that in some way the pollen
should be carried about. The flowers being rooted
in one place cannot carry their pollen where it
should go. Who shall do it for them?</p>

<p>Here is where the insect comes in. Let us look at
him. Insects vary much in size. Think of the
tiny ant and gnat. Then think of the great
bumble bee, or butterfly. You see this difference
in size fits them to visit little or big flowers.</p>

<p>You have seen the great bumble bee busy in a lily, or
a trumpet flower. Perhaps, too, you have seen a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
little ant, or gnat, come crawling out of the tiny
throat of the thyme or sage blossom. And you
have seen the wasp and bee, busy on the clover
blossom or the honeysuckle.</p>

<p>Insects have wings to take them quickly wherever
they choose to go. Even the ant, which has cast
off its wings,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> can crawl fast on its six nimble
legs.</p>

<p>Then, too, many insects have a long pipe, or tongue,
for eating. You have seen such a tongue on the
bee.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In this book you will soon read about the
butterfly, with its long tube which coils up like
a watch spring.</p>

<p>With this long tube the insect can poke into all the
slim cups, and horns, and folds, of the flowers of
varied shapes.</p>

<p>Is it not easy to see that when the insect flies into a
flower to feed, it may be covered with the pollen
from the stamens? Did you ever watch a bee
feeding in a wild rose? You could see his velvet
coat all covered with the golden flower dust.</p>

<p>Why does the insect go to the flower? He does not
know that he is needed to carry pollen about.
He never thinks of seed making. He goes into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the flower to get food. He eats pollen sometimes,
but mostly honey.</p>

<p>In business, you know, all the partners wish to make
some profit for themselves. The insect partner of
the flower has honey for his gains. The flower
lays up a drop of honey for him.</p>

<p>In most flowers there is a little honey. Did you ever
suck the sweet drop out of a clover, or a honeysuckle?
This honey gathers in the flower about
the time that the pollen is ripe in the boxes. Just
at the time that the flower needs the visit of the
insects, the honey is set ready for them.</p>

<p>Into the flower goes the insect for honey. As it moves
about, eating, its legs, its body, even its wings, get
dusty with pollen. When it has eaten the honey
of one flower, off it goes to another. And it
carries with it the pollen grains.</p>

<p>As it creeps into the next flower, the pollen rubs off
the insect upon the pistil. The pistil is usually
right in the insect’s way to the honey. The top
of the pistil is sticky, and it holds the pollen
grains fast. So here and there goes the insect,
taking the pollen from one flower to another.</p>

<p>But stop a minute. The pollen from a rose will not
make the seed germs of a lily grow. The tulip
can do nothing with pollen from a honeysuckle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
The pollen of a buttercup is not wanted by any
flower but a buttercup. So of all. The pollen to
do the germ any good must come from a flower
of its own kind.</p>

<p>What is to be done in this case? How will the insect
get the pollen to the right flower? Will it not
waste the clover pollen on a daisy?</p>

<p>Now here comes in a very strange habit of the insect.
Insects fly “from flower to flower,” but they go
from flowers of one kind to other flowers of the
<i>same kind</i>. Watch a bee. It goes from clover to
clover, not from clover to daisy.</p>

<p>Notice a butterfly. It flits here and there. But you
will see it settle on a pink, and then on another
pink, and on another, and so on. If it begins
with golden rod, it keeps on with golden rod.</p>

<p>God has fixed this habit in insects. They feed for a
long time on the same kind of flowers. They do
this, even if they have to fly far to seek them. If
I have in my garden only one petunia, the butterfly
which feeds in that will fly off over the fence
to some other garden to find another petunia.
He will not stop to get honey from my sweet
peas.</p>

<p>Some plants have drops of honey all along up the stem
to coax ants or other creeping insects up into the
flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>But other plants have a sticky juice along the stem, to
keep crawling insects away. In certain plants the
bases of the leaf-stems form little cups, for holding
water. In this water, creeping insects fall and
drown.</p>

<p>Why is this? It is because insects that would not
properly carry the pollen to another flower, would
waste it. So the plant has traps, or sticky bars,
to keep out the kind of insects that would waste
the pollen, or would eat up the honey without
carrying off the pollen.</p>

<p>I have not had time to tell you of the many shapes of
flowers. You must notice that for yourselves.</p>

<p>Some are like cups, some like saucers, or plates, or
bottles, or bags, or vases. Some have long horns,
some have slim tubes or throats. Some are all
curled close about the stamens and pistils.</p>

<p>These different kinds of flowers need different kinds of
insects to get their pollen. Some need bees with
thick bodies. Some need butterflies with long, slim
tubes. Some need wasps with long, slender bodies
and legs. Some need little creeping ants, or tiny
gnats.</p>

<p>Each kind of flower has what will coax the right kind
of insects, and keep away the wrong ones. What
has the plant besides honey to coax the insect for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
a visit? The flower has its lovely color, not for
us, but for insects. The sweet perfume is also for
insects.</p>

<p>Flowers that need the visits of moths, or other insects
that fly by night, are white or pale yellow.
These colors show best at night. Flowers that
need the visits of day-flying insects, are mostly
red, blue, orange, purple, scarlet.</p>

<p>There are some plants, as the grass, which have no
sweet perfume and no gay petals. I have told
you of flowers which are only a small brown scale
with a bunch of stamens and pistils held upon it.
And they have no perfumes. These flowers want
no insect partners. Their partner is the summer
wind! The wind blows the pollen of one plant to
another. That fashion suits these plants very well.</p>

<p>So, by means of insect or wind partners, the golden
pollen is carried far and wide, and seeds ripen.</p>

<p>But what about the bird partners? Where do they
come in?</p>

<p>If the ripe seed fell just at the foot of the parent plant,
and grew there, you can see that plants would be
too much crowded. They would spread very little.
Seeds must be carried from place to place. Some
light seeds, as those of the thistle, have a plume.
The maple seeds have wings. By these the wind
blows them along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>But most seeds are too heavy to be wind driven. They
must be carried. For this work the plant takes its
partner, the bird.</p>

<p>To please the eye of the bird, and attract it to the seed,
the plant has gay-colored seeds. Also it has often
gay-colored seed cases. The rose haws, you
know, are vivid red. The juniper has a bright
blue berry. The smilax has a black berry. The
berries of the mistletoe are white, of the mulberry
purple.</p>

<p>These colors catch the eye of the bird. Down he flies
to swallow the seed, case, and all. Also many
seed cases, or covers, are nice food to eat. They
are nice for us. We like them. But first of all
they were spread out for the bird’s table.</p>

<p>Birds like cherries, plums, and strawberries. Did you
ever watch a bird picking blackberries? The
thorns do not bother him. He swallows the berries
fast,—pulp and seed.</p>

<p>You have been told of the hard case which covers the
soft or germ part of the seed, and its seed-leaf
food. This case does not melt up in the bird’s
crop or gizzard, as the soft food does. So when it
falls to the ground the germ is safe, and can
sprout and grow.</p>

<p>Birds carry seeds in this way from land to land, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
well as from field to field. They fly over the sea
and carry seeds to lonely islands, which, but for
the birds, might be barren.</p>

<p>So by means of its insect partners, the plant’s seed
germs grow, and perfect seeds. By means of the
bird partners, the seeds are carried from place
to place. Thus many plants grow, and men are
clothed, and warmed, and fed.</p>

<p class="ph3">AIR, WATER, AND SAND PLANTS.</p>


<p>Most of the plants which you see about you grow in
earth or soil. You have heard your father say
that the grass in some fields was scanty because
the soil was poor. You have been told that wheat
and corn would not grow in some other field,
because the soil was not rich enough.</p>

<p>You understand that. The plant needs good soil,
made up of many kinds of matter. These minerals
are the plant’s food. Perhaps you have
helped your mother bring rich earth from the
forest, to put about her plants.</p>

<p>But beside these plants growing in good earth in the
usual way, there are plants which choose quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
different places in which to grow. There are air-plants,
water-plants, sand-plants. Have you seen
all these kinds of plants?</p>

<p>You have, no doubt, seen plants growing in very
marshy, wet places, as the rush, the iris, and the
St. John’s-wort. Then, too, you have seen plants
growing right in the water, as the water-lilies,
yellow and white; the little green duck-weed;
and the water crow-foot.</p>

<p>If you have been to the sea-shore, you have seen green,
rich-looking plants, growing in a bank of dry sand.
In the West and South, you may find fine plants
growing in what seem to be drifts, or plains of
clear sand.</p>

<p>Air-plants are less common. Let us look at them first.
There are some plants which grow upon other
plants and yet draw no food from the plant on
which they grow. Such plants put forth roots,
leaves, stems, blossoms, but all their food is drawn
from the air.</p>

<p>I hope you may go and see some hot-house where
orchids are kept. You will see there splendid
plants growing on a dead branch, or some other
dry thing, high up in the air.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a piece of mistletoe? It grows on
some tree. It has nice green leaves and white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
berries. That the mistletoe draws all its food
from the air has been proved. It thrives as well
on a dead tree as on a live one. A Frenchman,
who loved to study plants, made a mistletoe plant
grow on a cannon ball. Another mistletoe
sprouted and grew from a seed held out on the
point of a copper needle.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, these air-plants gain all their food from
the air.</p>

<p>Water-plants will seem to you to grow in a more natural
way. Most of them are rooted in the earth
at the bottom of the pond, or ditch, where they
grow. As the blossoms form, the flower stem
grows long, and the flower rises to the top of the
water.</p>

<p>There the lovely blossom floats about in the sunshine.
It is moored by its long stem to the root, as a boat
is moored by a rope. When the seeds are ripe,
the flower stem sinks down again. The leaf stems
rise to the top of the water. There the leaves lie
spread out, to breathe the air.</p>

<p>Now when these leaves of water-plants are made to
grow to the top of the water and live, they are
broad, and often shaped like a shield. They are
to spread out on the surface of the water, and
catch all the air and sunshine that they can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>But there are other kinds of water-plants which have
their leaves growing down under the water. All
these leaves made to stay in the water are fringe-like
and narrow. They look like wide leaves cut
into many small strips.</p>

<p>Most sea-weeds have fringe-like leaves. Yet there are
sea-weeds with wide leaves. They, like the fish,
are made to live in the water all the time.</p>

<p>The fresh-water plants generally mean to come to the
top of the water some time. They have green
leaves. Their leaves can keep green only by the
action on them of the air and light. This is why
the leaf is made fringe-like. Its fringed leaves
act as a net, floating around in the water. These
leaf-nets catch not fish, but air-bubbles, and rays
of light.</p>

<p>The water crow-foot, or water buttercup, has two kinds
of leaves. Those at the bottom of the stalk are
all in fine fringes. The leaves at the top are
broad, like other crow-foot leaves.</p>

<p>There are some water-plants which do not root at the
bottom of the pond. They spend all their lives
floating about. A little plant called “duck-weed”
is one of them. It has a soft, green body like two
halves of a tiny pea. Its roots are three or four
fine threads. It gathers all its food from the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Most water-plants have two sets of roots. One set
holds the plant fast in its place. The other roots
spring from the base of the leaves. They gather
food from the water.</p>

<p>Now, while leaves that grow in the water are fringe-like,
I think you will see that leaves of plants that
grow in sand must be just the opposite.</p>

<p>If you examine a plant growing in dry sand, you will
find that it has thick, soft, juicy leaves. The leaves
of sand-plants are seldom flat. They are shaped
like fringes, or the palm of your hand, or like little
rolls.</p>

<p>Why is that? Can you not guess? The roots of these
sand-living plants can get very little water. Only
when rain and heavy dew fall can they get moisture.
If they are wise little plants, they will store
moisture up.</p>

<p>These sand-plants store up food and moisture in their
leaves. It may surprise you that plants, growing
in such dry places, have leaves so full of juice.
The leaves are their pantry. They are full of
saved-up water.</p>

<p>You will notice another thing. Many of the sand-plants
have their leaves covered with prickles,
hooks, and thorns. The leaves are rough, like
burrs. Why is that? Is it not so, that birds and
beasts will not want to eat them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>If the leaves are nipped off by animals, these plants
must die. Their sand home gives them no water
for their roots. If the leaves are eaten, all the
plant must perish.</p>

<p>As there is so little water in the sand to carry food
to the plant through the roots, the leaves of these
plants must do most of their eating. So in the
sand-growing plants the leaves serve as mouth,
stomach, and pantry.</p>

<p>By the sea-side you will find plenty of sand-growing
plants. You can study them, and prove these
points for yourselves.</p>

<p>Children who are not by the sea may, perhaps, have,
near where they live, a curious sand-loving plant,
the cactus. The cactus prefers a sandy soil. I
have seen a large cactus, covered with yellow
blooms, growing right in a drift of clear sand.</p>

<p>You will notice that what you call the leaves of the
cactus are not real leaves, but thick, odd-shaped
stems. These stems are green, and answer for
leaves. They are of many queer shapes. They
are covered with little clusters of prickles. As
they serve for leaves, these odd stems of a sand-plant
are fleshy and juicy. The plant stores its
food and drink in them.</p>

</figure>

<p>You have now heard of so many wonders about plants,
that perhaps nothing new which you will hear of
them will surprise you. You may not even say
“Oh!” when I tell you that some plants eat bugs,—as
ants, gnats, and flies,—and will not even
refuse a nice bit of raw meat!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>These plants are called the “flesh-eaters.” The name
is a long one,—carnivora. Here is a verse about
them. As it has long, hard words in it, I wish to
say I did not make it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">They should not eat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or do aught so degrading.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These animal-eating plants are so made that they catch
insects, and suck up, or draw out, the juice of
their bodies. This juice the plant seems to feed
upon. It has been seen to pass from the leaf
which catches the insect into the stem and other
parts of the plant.</p>

<p>In all these insect-eating plants, it is the leaf that
does the killing and eating.</p>

<p>I will first tell you of a little water-plant of this queer
class. It is called the bladder-plant. It is one of
the water-plants which float free. On the fringe-like
leaves are little bags or bladders. These are
full of air, and help the plant to float. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
mouth of these little bags has a door opening inward.
It is set round with hairs.</p>

<p>The little insect-larvæ which live in water, and other
tiny animals that swim about, see these little floating
bags, with the small, green doors. The creatures
act as if they wanted to know what was
inside such pretty places. Finally they go in.
To go in is easy. But once in, they cannot get
out. The little door will not open outwards.</p>

<p>After a day or two, the animal thus trapped is all
eaten. Only the hard, horny parts, which serve
for its bones, are left.</p>

<p>There is another small plant, called the sun-dew, which
eats insects. Any of you who live near a cranberry
bog can find sun-dew growing on the edges
of the bog. It is a plant that lives in wet places.</p>

<p>The sun-dew has a number of leaves about the size and
shape of pearl shirt-buttons. They grow on short
stems close to the ground. The leaves are covered
with red hairs. These hairs are called tentacles.
As many as a hundred and fifty will grow on one
little leaf.</p>

<p>From these long, red hairs come tiny drops of sticky
stuff. These drops gleam like dew. From them,
and the little red, hairy rays, the plant has its
name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The insect comes flying by. The “dew” looks like something
good to eat. But as soon as the insect
touches the leaf, the juice holds its legs fast. The
insect begins to kick, but cannot get away.</p>

<p>The struggles of the insect seem to irritate the plant.
For, when the hairs are touched, they pour out
more juice. Not only this, but the touch of the
insect on the hairs causes the leaf to bend upwards.
It bends over, over, folding down, until
it is all shut up upon the insect.</p>

<p>Here is the insect held in the folded leaf. The glue
runs out over it faster than ever. When you
think how the insect breathes through tubes
wound over all its body,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> you will see that it must
soon smother, held in this sticky juice.</p>

<p>When the leaf is bent over the insect, the juice changes.
When the leaf is so bent, the juice is acid, or sour.
This acid juice melts up the body of the insect.
As it melts, the mouths, or glands, of the leaf
seem to suck it up.</p>

<p>The sun-dew will melt up and devour bits of meat laid
on the leaf. Water-drops on the leaf will not
make it bend. But when milk-drops are put on
the leaf, it bends, and sucks them up.</p>

<p>The leaf will not close over a piece of stone, or glass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
But it will close over a bit of boiled egg, or a scrap
of bone. It melts the bone so soft, that you can
stick a needle into it.</p>

<p>Another animal-eating plant is the Venus’s-flytrap.
It grows only in North Carolina. The leaf-blade
has sharp bristles about the upper part. Each half
of the leaf hollows a little, so that when the two
halves come together they form a small pouch.</p>

<p>The leaf has some fine hairs which an insect cannot but
touch, when it moves on the leaf. When the hairs
are touched, the leaf bends. The bristles on the
edges lock together, so that the insect is held in a
cage, even before the leaf closes.</p>

<p>When the leaf is fully closed, the insect is held in a bag
prison. The glands then pour out juice to melt
up the body of the insect. As it melts, its juices
are drawn into the plant.</p>

<p>The Venus’s-flytrap does not seem to depend alone on
the chance lighting of the insect upon it. It has
a sweet juice on the leaf to attract insects. But it
does not need as much sticky fluid as the sun-dew,
to hold the insect. The two halves of the leaf
snap together like a trap. They give the insect
no time to get away.</p>

<p>Another very odd plant which eats insects is the side-saddle
plant. This is often called the pitcher-plant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
It looks far more like a pitcher than like
a saddle. The leaves of this plant are like a beautiful
pitcher painted red and green.</p>

<p>These plants are common in the South. They grow
also in marshy places in the North. I remember
how happy I was when my father brought me
three of them, when I was a little girl.</p>

<p>There are two or three kinds of these pitcher-plants.
One kind is green, spotted with red, and has some
yellow lines. Another kind is green with purple
marks. You must notice that the inner side of
the lid is of the brightest color.</p>

<p>Why is this? Insects see the gay color and fly to the
plant. The leaves of the pitcher-plant are large,
and they are bent and the edges grow together
nearly all the way up. This forms a close pitcher
which will hold water.</p>

<p>The seam where the leaves are joined is usually of a
light yellow color. It is covered with a honey-like
juice, in small drops. The rim of the pitcher and
the inside of the neck have also these honey
drops.</p>

<p>The insects, attracted by the gay color, come to feed on
the honey. They feed along the seam and rim,
and so into the throat of the pitcher. They seem
to get dizzy, or so full of honey, that they feel dull.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
They get down into the pitcher, and—there they
stay!</p>

<p>Why do they not come out? For three reasons. The
inside of the pitcher has a band of hairs growing
downward. The insects cannot creep up through
these. The hairs turn them back, as a brush fence
turns cattle.</p>

<p>Then, too, part of the inside of the pitcher is so smooth
that insects fall back when they walk on it. Still,
as they can walk on glass, I think their slipping
back must be due more to being dizzy, than to the
smooth surface.</p>

<p>And here is the third reason, the pitcher is half full of
liquid, and this liquid seems to make the insect
dizzy. This liquid looks like pure, clear water. It
tastes like the root of the plant,—a biting taste.</p>

<p>It is not like the honey-dew which lies on the seam
for a bait. In this liquid, inside, the insects are
drowned.</p>

<p>You may find many dead insects in one pitcher. I told
you a little about this, in the last book, in the
lessons on flies.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The dead bodies of the insects
melted up seem to help to feed the plant. But
often a pitcher catches more insects than the plant
can use.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>
<p>There are many kinds of pitcher-plants in very warm
lands. You may be able to see some of them in
hot-houses. All have the same general way of
killing and eating insects.</p>

<p class="ph3">WEATHER PROPHET PLANTS.</p>


<p>Once, when I was a little girl, I ran one morning to
the garden, and said to the old Scotchman who
worked there, “To-day I am going up the mountain
for berries.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Missey, not to-day,” he said; “it will rain.”
“No, it will not rain,” I said. “The sun is up.
The cook says it will be fair. The glass in the
hall does not say rain.”</p>

<p>“Tuts, tuts,” said the old man. “I care for no suns,
or cooks, or glasses. The pimpernel says it will
rain, and so it <i>will</i> rain. Flowers, Missey, always
tell the truth. When they say ‘rain,’ go, get your
umbrella.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, by noon, the rain was pouring down.
After that, I looked with great respect at the tiny
flower, sometimes brick red, sometimes blue, which
could tell about the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp46" id="i_089" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A RAINY DAY.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the
pimpernel
is
not the
only
plant that is a weather
prophet. We will look
first at some plants, and
then at some seeds, which
tell about the weather.</p>

<p>If you go into the garden,
and find the African
marigold shut, after seven
o’clock in the morning,
you may be pretty sure
that there will be a rainy
day.</p>

<p>But while the African marigold
stays shut for rain,
the Siberian thistle gets
ready for rain, by keeping
open. If this thistle
does not close at night,
you may look out for rain
next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>You see the marigold, which had origin in a hot land,
stays folded, to keep the rain out of its petals.
But the thistle, which had origin in a cold, stormy
land, keeps wide open to get a good washing.</p>

<p>Did you ever see near the way-side the pretty little
morning-glory or bind-weed, with its pink and
white blossoms? Even if it is wide open, in the
early day, it twists its striped cup close together,
and droops its head, if a rain cloud drifts across
the sky. It seems to want to shield its stamens
and pistil from the wet.</p>

<p>There is a little single marigold, which shuts up in a
hurry if the sky becomes clouded. It is called the
“rainy-marigold.”</p>

<p>Most plants which we call “weather prophets” shut
up for rain. But some plants open for rain. The
cause of the opening and closing is probably the
difference in light. Most likely, these plants shut
their flowers because there is too little light, not
because there is too much moisture.</p>

<p>But you know there are some plants which shrink from
a strong light, and love the shade. You will find
that most shade-loving plants, as the verbenas,
do not close for rain.</p>

<p>Lilies, tulips, and other flowers that love the sun, shut
for rain. The tulip and crocus families are among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
our best weather prophets. Just as the gay tulip
shuts at evening, when the dew begins to fall, so
it shuts for a shower.</p>

<p>Tulips are careful not to open their cups very wide in
the morning, if it is likely to rain. The roses
make no change; they seem not to fear wet.</p>

<p>On the whole, you may be pretty sure, if you go into
your garden, and find many flowers, as tulips,
marigolds, morning-glories, and celandine, shut, it
will be a stormy day, unfit for picnics or long walks.</p>

<p>Just as some blossoms are weather prophets, so are
some seeds. But in the case of the seeds it is the
moisture, not the light, which affects them.</p>

<p>Among these seeds, that of the wild-oat is chief.
When the air is moist, the long bristles, called
awns, on the seed, squirm and twist. In old
times, before people knew why this was, they said
that this seed was a witch!</p>

<p>There is a marigold which grows at the Cape of Good
Hope, and in dry weather has its head of seeds
held close, like a round button. When rain is
coming, this seed-head opens out, like a star with
many points.</p>

<p>Do you see the use of these motions? The wild-oat, as
it wriggles and twists back and forth, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
dampness of the air, or earth, twists its way into
the soil. It plants itself by these motions.</p>

<p>The marigold keeps its seeds safe in dry weather, which
would kill them. When rain comes, it opens the
seed-head. Then the seeds fall out on moist earth,
where they will sprout and grow.</p>

<p>Some seed-pods fly open when they are dry. The
sand-box tree has seed-pods as large as an orange.
They fly open in dry weather.</p>

<p>What is the reason of all these queer actions of the
flowers? No doubt they are all due to light and
moisture. To light, most of all.</p>

<p>The little pimpernel probably needs much heat and
light to open its petals. Even a little moisture
in the air, or a little less light than it likes, will
cause it to keep shut.</p>

<p>A pimpernel in full bloom will close its blossoms
almost as soon as you pick it. Very likely the
slight moisture of your hand causes it to do that.</p>

<p>This motion of closing, during rain, may be very useful
to some flowers. A frail flower with a large cup,
such as a tulip or crocus, might, if open, be broken
to pieces by a heavy shower. These flowers fold
up, and expose only a close-pointed bud, to the
storm. Then no rain can get among the petals.</p>

<p>Also, the rain might break the large pollen cases of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
tulip, and wash the pollen all away. So, if the
convolvulus had its long tube filled with water,
the stamens and pistil would perhaps be harmed,
and its seeds would not be able to grow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XIV">LESSON XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">PLANT CLOCKS.</p>


<p>I knew an old man who made a great clock for his
grandchildren. What kind of a clock do you suppose
it was? The clock was in the garden, and it
was made of flowers.</p>

<p>Did it tell the time well? Only pretty well. Flower
clocks are as liable to get out of order as clocks
made at a factory.</p>

<p>This clock was a great flower bed, divided into twelve
parts. The divisions were marked out by little
rows of box-plants. In the middle was a post
three feet high. It had two clock hands on it,
but <i>they</i> were only for show. They did not move.</p>

<p>But the post had a sun-dial on it, and that gave true
time. So the children could tell when the flower
clock was not working well.</p>

<p>As there are twelve hours of day and twelve of night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
and some plants open only at night, each of the
twelve divisions of the clock was divided into two
parts by a little line of red colors. On one side of
this were the night bloomers, on the other side the
day bloomers.</p>

<p>The children thought it lovely, and were proud of it.
And the clock did for them what the grandfather
wished,—it made them like and notice plants.</p>

<p>I have just said that there are plants which open only
by night, and others which open only by day.
This opening and shutting for day and night is
called “the sleep of plants.”</p>

<p>This sleep of plants is not because the plant is tired;
it is due to the absence or presence of light, and
to changes in the amount of light. Yet, no doubt,
in it the organs of the plant do rest, as their
growth and action are not then so rapid.</p>

<p>Both the flowers and the leaves of plants have this
sleep motion. We will look first at the sleep of
flowers.</p>

<p>You have noticed that the morning-glories are open
when you rise, and that they fold or shut up by
noon. Have you in your garden a flower with
gay yellow or scarlet blossoms, called the four-o’clock?
That does not open until about four
in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>As you run to school in the morning, the dandelions
are gay along the way-side. When you come from
school in the afternoon, the dandelions are all
folded in their green cups.</p>

<p>If this is so, why does not the flower-clock tell true
time? You can see that owing to the changes in
the heat and rising of the sun in different places,
and seasons, the sleep of the flowers would not
begin at the same time.</p>

<p>I have seen my morning-glories open as late as nine
o’clock, and stay open all day in cool October days.
In August they opened by six and were shut by
eleven. So the four-o’clocks and dandelions may
vary by an hour or two.</p>

<p>All the water-lilies shut at night. Some not only shut,
but draw their heads down under water. I will
tell you when you will find some flowers opening.
At four in the morning you will find the goat’s-beard
and the blue chicory opening. The chicory
petals are then a fine blue. They become
lighter in color until near mid-day, when they are
almost white. Chicory is called “Miss-go-to-bed-at-noon”
by some children, as the flowers shut at
noon.</p>

<p>At five in the morning the common morning-glory and
the poppy open. At six the yellow hawk’s-weed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
and dandelions look out on the way-side. At
seven the water-lilies smile at us. At eight, if the
day is fine, the pimpernel opens its red eyes.</p>

<p>At nine the marigold spreads out, and the tulip. At
noon, on a hot day, you will find the tulip opened
nearly flat. At eleven the Star of Bethlehem
shuts up, while most of the day flowers are in
their best bloom.</p>

<p>At twelve the lazy passion-flowers awake, and the sweet-peas
have their banners opened wide. At two the
wild daisies are brightest. Then at four in the
afternoon, out comes the four-o’clocks, and at five
the “beauty of the night,” and at six the delicate
evening primrose. At seven the white lychnis,
which blooms only at night, opens. Later still
the night primrose puts out its white bloom, and
at two o’clock in the morning the purple convolvulus
wakes up and wonders why the sun is so late.</p>

<p>Now, in sleeping, most of the flowers close tight together.
Besides the rest to the growing organs, which sleep
brings them, this folding up keeps moisture from
the pollen. Also, the flowers, whose partners are
day-flying insects, keep out of the way of night
insects by closing their pretty doors.</p>

<p>The evening primroses, night lychnis, and others, which
have night-flying insect partners, keep shut when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
day insects are about. You will notice that most
of these night plants have yellow or white petals,
and a sweet perfume.</p>

<p>I have told you the leaves sleep also. Leaves sometimes
sleep by closing the two halves of the leaf
together by the mid-vein. Other leaves sleep by
dropping the leaves down against the stem.</p>

<p>A young Swiss girl was one of the first to observe this
sleep motion of leaves. She saw it first in the
clover. When the leaves sleep in this way, you
might think them faded and dying.</p>

<p>You will do well to watch this sleep of leaves. If you
go into a garden, or field, or on the road-side, you
will see that the leaves look very different after
sunset from what they did in the noon-day.</p>

<p>The yellow sorrel and the clover are plants in which
you can watch leaf-sleep well. You will find the
small leaflets hanging down against the stalk. So
if you look at the beans in the garden, you will see
their leaves falling back, and perhaps a little bent
over. One kind of oxalis, with very small, compound
leaves, lifts its leaves up all in a bunch to go
to sleep.</p>

<p>The leaves of trees have sleep-change. The mimosa
and the barberry close their leaves at night.</p>

<p>Are these sleep motions of any use to plants? Yes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
It has been found that this folding up, and falling
back of leaves, will help them to resist cold and
wet.</p>

<p>If, during a cold night, you pin the leaves out, so they
cannot take the sleep position, they are likely to
freeze. Also this change in the leaves, at night,
helps to shield the plant from too much dew.</p>

<p>Sometimes, also, it is of use as it turns toward the dew
the under side of the leaf. This under side has
the most mouths for drinking water. Thus the
flower has a good drink at night, after the dry, hot
day.</p>

<p>Among the other motions of plants, I might speak of
that of some leaves, which curl or shrink if you
touch them. But I have not space for that now.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that these lessons have told you a
great many things about flowers. If you go on with
the study of plants, you will see how much there
is to tell, and how very little has here been told.</p>

<p>These lessons are only meant to stir up your interest
in plants, and show you what wonders are in the
plant world. After that, you will be sure to learn
more for yourselves.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE SCHOOL CABINET.</p>


<p>One of the wise teachers who are all the time thinking
what will help and interest children wrote me a
letter. In it, he said, “If you wish to do our school
children a real service, write something about cabinets
in our schools. In each school-house there
should be a collection of natural history objects,
brought together by teachers and children. This
would be of great use, and the children would take
pleasure in collecting specimens.”</p>

<p>So, right here, in the middle of this Third Book, I want
to say a word about cabinets of natural curiosities.</p>

<p>In the Second Book I told you here and there how you
might catch and keep a specimen. I told you how
to dry beetles, star-fish, and a few other little animals.</p>

<p>If you make a collection of this kind, you can look at
the object when you read of it in the book. That
will help you to understand it and will interest
you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>In a cabinet you could keep safely for use many nice
things, which might otherwise be wasted. Also,
you might spend some of your pennies in buying
specimens. I think pennies are much better spent
so than for candy and cake.</p>

<p>If you are collecting a cabinet of curiosities, I think
you might write letters to other schools, or far off
friends to ask them to send you specimens.</p>

<p>You might offer to trade objects, of which you have
several, for something which other people have,
and you have not.</p>

<p>I think, too, you would be very happy out of doors,
looking for specimens. And I believe you and
your teachers would be greater friends than ever,
if you were all helping each other to get a cabinet
together.</p>

<p>If, at first, you cannot have a cabinet case with glass
doors, have some shelves. Have some boxes to set
on the shelves, and lay pieces of glass over the
boxes for covers. Those little paper boxes—,
which jewellers and druggists use, are very nice for
small objects,—as seeds, little shells, and so on.
Nearly all children have some of these boxes.</p>

<p>When you have specimens in these little boxes, the
teacher will write the name of the object on the
box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>I knew a boy, who made a very nice collection of many
kinds of wood. He cut the wood into wedges,
with a bit of the bark left on. One side of the
wedge he polished with glass and sand paper. One
side he left rough. He wrote on each piece of
wood the name of the tree from which it came.</p>

<p>I once saw some lovely pictures of leaves. They were
made by a little girl. How did she make them?
Could she paint? No.</p>

<p>She had some small sheets of stiff paper. She got some
printer’s ink in a cup. She made two little balls
of woollen cloth. She would take a nice, fresh,
perfect leaf, and with one ball she would put a
little ink, very gently, over all the under surface
of the leaf. Then the next thing was to lay the
leaf, inked side down, on a sheet of stiff paper, and
pat it gently all over with the other woollen ball.</p>

<p>When she lifted up the leaf she had a picture of its
shape, and of all its veins and edges. It looked
like a nice engraving. She put the same kinds of
leaves on the same sheet,—as the leaves of the
rose family on one, the leaves of maples on
another, and so on. Under each leaf she wrote its
name.</p>

<p>Such a collection of leaf-patterns is fine in a cabinet.
So is a collection of dried flowers,—called an herbarium.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Your mother or teacher could show you
how to make one.</p>

<p>You will find on the way-side, or in field and garden,
some of those wonderful nests, built by spiders,
wasps and bees, of which you read in the First
Book of Nature Readers. And at the sea-side, you
can find crabs, shells, and bits of coral, sponge and
sea-weed.</p>

<p>Did you ever think what a pretty sight a row of pieces
of many kinds of stone makes? Have you
thought that stones are just hard, homely, brown
things?</p>

<p>Have you noticed that marble is sometimes snow white,
sometimes black, or veined with many colors?
The granite is gray; sandstone is red, or gray, or
purplish. Slate is black, purple, or veined in many
shades. Other stones are black, red, yellow, brown,
green, in fact of nearly all hues.</p>

<p>Each kind of stone has its own name. Some come
from one place only, some from another. There is
a reason why each kind has its color and grain.
As you grow older, you may like to study about
rocks and stones. Then how nice it will be to
have on hand a collection of specimens.</p>

<p>A collection of birds’ nests is very fine. As we study
in this book a little about birds, you will see how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
many kinds of nests there are. If you have a
cabinet you can put into it one nest of each kind
that you can find. Put into each nest one egg of
the kind that belongs to the nest. Then put into
the nest a little card, with the name of the bird,
and the number of eggs commonly laid in each
nest.</p>

<p>Be sure you do not break up the nest of a sitting bird.
That is cruel. To keep the eggs you must blow
them. Make a hole with a large pin in each end
of the egg. Then blow hard, steadily in the pin-hole
in the large end. All the inside of the egg
will fly out at the hole at the other end.</p>

<p>Our next lesson will be about grasshoppers and their
cousins. As the bodies of grasshoppers shrink
when they dry, it is well to stuff them. How can
you do that?</p>

<p>Put a little cotton wool on the end of a short thread,
threaded in a long, coarse needle. The grasshopper
should have been dead an hour or two,
before you try to stuff it. Take it by the head
and pass the needle through from the back end of
the body, and bring it out under the breast. If
you draw it gently, the cotton will go in with the
thread.</p>

<p>Several pieces of cotton drawn in, in this way, will fill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the body enough to hold it in shape. If the cotton
is wet in alcohol, or camphor, it is better.</p>

<p>Worms, spiders, toads, minnows, and such soft-bodied
things, must be kept in clear glass bottles, filled
with alcohol.</p>

<p>Now the chief thing in a collection is to have it good
of its kind. The specimens should be as perfect
as possible, and be kept neat and clean. Especially
they should be set in good order. They should all
have labels, with their names on them.</p>

<p>A collection well marked will be worth much more
than one without the names placed on the specimens.
A collection all jumbled together, without
order, will be of little use.</p>

<p>If you set a bird’s nest here, a wasp’s nest there, a
bright stone next, and then a beetle, or a card of
butterflies, your cabinet will have small teaching
value. Remember a cabinet is not merely made to
“look pretty” like a doll’s house, or a shop
window.</p>

<p>Place things of a kind together. Then put kinds
which are nearest like next each other. Put your
insects together, and arrange them by their orders.
Put the beetles together, the butterflies together,
the wasps, and bees, and so on. Spiders come in
as one order of the insects. Your crabs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
shrimps must stand together, but be placed next
the insects, as they are of the jointed class of
creatures.</p>

<p>Put your birds’ nests, and eggs, and any stuffed birds,
or pictures of birds that you may have, together.
And so on, with all the other things.</p>

<p>Your cabinet may be a small one, but if it is neatly
arranged, and all the specimens are good of their
kind, rightly named, and kept clean, it will be of
real value.</p>

<p>Do not be in such a hurry to collect, that you put in
rubbish, instead of good specimens. A butterfly
with broken wings, a beetle without a head, and a
spider that has lost half its legs, are not worth a
place in a cabinet.</p>

<p>To get together even a small cabinet of objects in
natural history, takes time, care, and patience.
I knew a girl who was carefully collecting and
mounting beetles. In a whole summer she got
only twenty-five. But each one was perfect, different
from the rest, nicely fastened in place, and
had its name written beside it. So her collection
was of real value.</p>

<p>After you have secured a nice little cabinet, the trouble
will be to keep it safe, and in order. Specimens
must be taken care of. All specimens of plants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
and insects, are very liable to be destroyed by little
bugs. Only the things kept in alcohol are really
safe from being eaten.</p>

<p>Camphor and red pepper are of some use to keep out
these enemies. Your teachers will know, or can
easily learn, how to prepare the specimens with
poisons, which will kill the mites and not harm
you or the specimens. You must leave it to them.</p>

<p>It is nice to have a case with glass doors. If you cannot
have that, arrange as many of the objects as
you can in boxes with panes of glass laid over
them. For open cabinets it is well to have a piece
of fine gauze to lay over each shelf, or over the
whole set of shelves, when the cabinet is not in
immediate use.</p>

<p>Dust makes a cabinet look very ugly. But you cannot
clean off beetles and butterflies with a dusting
cloth or brush. It would ruin such delicate things.</p>

<p>You can gently move the boxes and specimens, and
wipe off the shelves, and the sides of the boxes.
Then blow, or fan, the dust from the specimens.
Even minerals should have the dust blown from
them, not wiped off. It is easy to rub the bloom
and the little fine points, and edges, from a mineral
specimen.</p>

<p>When you have made up your minds to have a cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
in your school, look about and see what your
friends have to give you for it. Many people have
a few natural history curiosities, for which they do
not really care. Such persons would gladly give
their treasures to a school cabinet. But there
should be some bright little lad or lass to say: “Oh,
we have a cabinet at our school. Would you not
be willing to send these things there?”</p>

<p>Correct pictures of birds, fish, insects, and flowers, are
useful in a cabinet, but you must be sure that they
are correct before you give them a place. You
must not put the pictures into your cabinet merely
because they are pretty. If they are wrong they
will give you false ideas. I have seen colored
pictures of insects with some of the legs set upon
the hinder part of the body instead of all upon
the chest part. Such a picture is of no use.</p>

<p>Keen eyes to see what comes in your own way, and
keen wits to suggest to other people what they
can do for you, will steadily help to build up the
school cabinet.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE OLD MAN OF THE MEADOW.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_108" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE OLD MAN AND HIS FAMILY.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I was about seven years old, I caught a grasshopper
and put him into a bottle.</p>

<p>Then I sat down outside the bottle, and looked at the
grasshopper. He sat inside the bottle, and looked
at me.</p>

<p>It began to grow upon my mind that the grasshopper
looked much like an old man. His face, with the
big, solemn eyes, and straight mouth, was like an
old man’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>He wore a gray coat, like a loose duster. He had a
wrinkled greenish vest. He wore knee-breeches
and long red stockings.</p>

<p>The more I looked at him, the more he looked like a
little, grave, old-time man who came to visit my
aged grandfather.</p>

<p>I had a cousin who at dusk would sit with me in a
corner of the big sofa, and repeat to me a poem,
called the “Prisoner of Chillon.” That sad poem
had made me feel very sorry for all prisoners.
I thought my grasshopper in the bottle felt like
a prisoner. I said, “Now you may go, my Old
Man of the Meadow.”</p>

<p>I took the cork out of the bottle. The grasshopper at
once leaped up, and sat on the rim of the bottle.
Then a strange thing happened! The Old Man
of the Meadow spread out two wide brown wings.
They had a broad, lemon-colored band on them.
They were gay as the wings of a butterfly! On
them he sailed away!</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my eyes. I ran after him to a
tall stalk of golden-rod. There he sat a plain,
gray-green old man. But again he spread out the
wide wings, and was gone!</p>

<p>My Old Man of the Meadow had then this splendid
dress-coat under his sober overcoat! Seated at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
rest, he looked plain and quiet,—a creature of the
earth. Lifted into the air, he was nearly as fine
as a butterfly.</p>

<p>Do you not wish to know something more of this Old
Man of the Meadow, the grasshopper? The name
of this insect at once tells you something about
him. He lives much in the grass, and his chief
motion is in hops, or long jumps. He has another
name, “the murmurer.” This is given because of
the noise or song he makes. He sings to Mrs.
Grasshopper. His song is loud and shrill. It is
made by rubbing his wings one upon the other.</p>

<p>He has a little piece of skin like a tight drum-head set
in each wing. As he moves his wings, this tiny
drum vibrates, or trembles, and makes the shrill
sound.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grasshopper does not have this drum in her
wings. She has, however, at the end of her body,
a nice little sword. The French call her “the
jumper with the sword.” Is her sword to fight
with? No. This little sword opens into several
blades. She uses it to place her eggs snugly in
the ground. The sword blades open, and the eggs
slide safely down between them, into the little
earth-bed. There they lie until the young grasshoppers
hatch out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>You will find as we study about grasshoppers, that
they do not all live in the grass. Some spend
most of their time in trees.</p>

<p>Let us take a closer look at the grasshopper. As he is
an insect,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> he should have a body made in rings,
in three parts, with four wings and six legs set
on the second, or chest part.</p>

<p>Just here let us say, that if you will look closely you
will see that the head of an insect is made of four
rings, and its chest is made of three rings. They
are rings grown wider than the rest.</p>

<p>Our Old Man of the Meadow does not lack any of the
parts which a proper insect should have.</p>

<p>The order which he belongs to is called the <i>straight-wings</i>,
because the insects belonging to it do not
fold their wings crosswise.</p>

<p>The grasshopper family is called the family of “the
murmurers,” from their music.</p>

<p>There are six families of the straight-wings. In this
book we shall study a little about three of them,—the
grasshoppers, the crickets, and the locusts.
If you wish, also, to learn about their cousin,
the cockroach, suppose you, who live in city
houses, go down to the kitchen, and catch him
about the water pipes, and study him for yourselves!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>
<p>The order of straight-wings is often divided in this
way: The runners,—as the cockroach; the snatchers,
a kind which have their fore-feet something
like hands, to snatch with; the walkers, who seldom
fly or jump; and the jumpers. The grasshopper
is one of the jumpers.</p>

<p>If you look well at the grasshopper, you will see that
his front pair of legs is shorter than the others.
This hinders him in walking over a level surface.
But it helps him in walking up a tree, or small
plant, or a wall.</p>

<p>See the hind legs! They are more than twice as long
as the others. The thigh, or upper part, is very
long and strong. By means of these big legs, the
grasshopper is a famous jumper.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a grasshopper to look at, you will see
that the feet have four parts. The part of the
leg between the foot and the thigh has sharp
points like the teeth of a comb.</p>

<p>The hind part of the body is long and slender, and,
being made of rings, can bend easily. In the
great, green grasshopper all the body is of a fine
green tint.</p>

<p>Let us look at the wings. The upper pair, or wing-covers,
are large and long. Notice two things
about the wings; they lap at the tips, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
high in the middle. When they are shut, they
have a shape like a slanting roof. The upper
ones are longer than the lower ones.</p>

<p>These wing-cases have large veins. Lift up a wing-case
and pull out a lower wing. It is folded
very closely, in lengthwise plaits. Where these
wings join Mr. Grasshopper’s body, you will find
his drum-plate for making music. One kind of
grasshopper has very short wing-covers. In that
kind, both Mr. and Mrs. Grasshopper make music.
There is also one grasshopper, a little, green fellow,
that has no drum; he is silent.</p>

<p>The upper side of the grasshopper’s chest is shaped like
a large, horny collar. The head is large, and has
two big, glossy eyes. There is, also, a knob on the
forehead. Between the eyes, are set the feelers.
They are very long; even longer than all the body.</p>

<p>The mouth of the grasshopper is wide, and it has strong
jaws. But they are not so strong as those of his
cousin, the cricket.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers prefer vegetable food. They will sometimes
eat animal food. When shut up in a box,
they will fight, and the one which gets killed will
be eaten by the victor.</p>

<p>A grasshopper which lost its leg while being put into a
box, ate its leg. Like the other winged creatures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
grasshoppers lose their legs easily, and do not
seem to mind it.</p>

<p>If you could look inside the grasshopper’s body, you
would see that he has a gizzard, much like that
of a chicken. It is made of little bands set with
fine teeth. These teeth chew up into a pulp the
leaves which the grasshopper has eaten.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN OF THE MEADOW.</p>


<p>Many years ago, a great poet wrote a song to the grasshopper.
The poet said the grasshopper was the
happiest of living things. It did nothing but
dance and sing. It ate fresh leaves, and drank
cool dew. When the glad summer of its life was
done, it died. It did not live to be sick, or hungry,
or cold.</p>

<p>This poet called the grasshopper “the earth-born,” and
said that it was man’s little brother.</p>

<p>Yes, the grasshopper is earth-born. The mother grasshopper
makes, with the sword of which I told you,
a hole in the ground. In that she lays her eggs,
in a case made of something like glue. Then she
closes up the hole, and the eggs lie all winter, safe
in the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>In the spring, the larvæ hatch from the egg, and creep
out of the ground. They are very small, but
shaped much like the parent, only they have no
wings. They molt, or change their skins several
times.</p>

<p>At first, the little ones are all alike, but after several
changes of skin, the larvæ become pupæ. Then
you can see the coming wings under a little sheath.
You can also see Mrs. Grasshopper’s sword growing.</p>

<p>About six or eight weeks, after hatching, the final
change is made. The perfect insect comes out of
its last-shed skin. It has now two pairs of wings.
Mr. Grasshopper plays on his new drum, and Mrs.
Grasshopper marches about with her new sword.</p>

<p>The young grasshoppers are very greedy while larvæ
and pupæ. They eat all the time. When they
are grown, they do not give all their time to eating.
Mr. Grasshopper must sing, and he does not
do this while either flying or eating.</p>

<p>He stands quite still, fixes himself firmly by his fore-feet,
and presses his body downward. There is a
little quiver through all his body as long as the
sound lasts.</p>

<p>The people of Italy call him “the screamer,” or “the
squealer,” from his shrill noise.</p>

<p>The grasshopper has a very odd habit. After he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
eaten for a long time, he sits quite still. He looks
as if he were doing some serious thinking. Sometimes
when he sits in this way, he moves his mouth
as if chewing. From this action, people used to
think that he chewed the cud, as cows and sheep
do.</p>

<p>But he does not chew the cud. If you watch him well,
in these silent times, you will see him gravely
licking his long feelers, and his lips. He seems to
be cleaning them.</p>

<p>To do this, he runs out a long, limber tongue, shaped
much like yours. You remember that the ants
have this habit of cleaning and dressing themselves,
after eating.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The great, green grasshopper, which lives on the trees,
has wings of a gray-green. He has a little bronze,
or russet color, on his feet, and on the under part
of his body. The rest of his body is a fine leaf-green.</p>

<p>The color in the grasshopper does not seem to be laid
on the surface of his coat, as on that of the beetle.
It is not put on in plumes and scales, as the butterfly
has it. But it is dyed through and through
the wings and body.</p>

<p>The wing-cases of the grasshopper, and the rings of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
body, are not hard, and like horn or shell, as in
the beetle tribe. They are of a tough skin, and
are dyed with the color.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at some of these fine fellows. Although
the color of the great, green grasshopper
is so gay, it will be hard to find him. His coat is
just the tint of the leaves he likes to live among.
You can scarcely see him even if you look straight
at him.</p>

<p>You will find in the grass a smaller, lighter-green
hopper that is very easily caught, because in his
hurry to get away he flies right up in your face,
when he hears you coming.</p>

<p>The grasshoppers are a very timid family, and are very
sensitive to sound. Some say that their long
feelers serve them for ears. But that is not true.</p>

<p>The garden grasshopper has very small wings. Its
color is brownish gray. It likes to live in the
garden walls or under the leaves in the borders.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Grasshopper sing in this garden
family. They keep up fine music for those who
like to hear them, as one answers the song of the
other.</p>

<p>I think we most of us like the cry of the grasshopper.
It brings to our mind the warm, dry, sunny days,
the time of flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Out in the meadow you will find our Old Man, the common
great, gray hopper. As the great, green one
in the trees is hidden by his color, so is the great,
gray one hidden in the grass. His coat is the hue
of the half-dry grass, with little tinges of green
along it.</p>

<p>He seems a very plain insect at first. But watch him
and notice the light red and yellowish bands on his
legs. He has spots of soot color on his wing cases.
When he spreads his wide wings, note the brown
and yellow stripes. He is fine enough after all.</p>

<p>In the woods, among the pine and fir trees, you will find
a light-green, small, slim grasshopper a deal like
the garden singer.</p>

<p>There is a very handsome, large grasshopper called the
wart-biter. The boys in Sweden give him this
name, because they think he can cure warts. They
think that if he bites a wart, and puts some dark
brown juice on it, the wart will go away.</p>

<p>The wart-biter is nearly two inches long. It is a green-gray
with reddish legs and feet. It lays its eggs
in little balls in the earth.</p>

<p>In South America there are very large and splendid
grasshoppers. Their wings are so gay that when
they fly they look much like butterflies. The
wings, in flight, cover most of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>But when you see the large, long legs stretched out
behind, and the very long feelers waving to the
tips of the wings, you will know that this is a
grasshopper. All this brown and black and crimson
splendor is the Old Man of the Meadow, with
a very fine coat.</p>

<p>The grasshopper is not migratory. It does not change
its home. It dies near where it was born. Frost
and cold kill it. It does not outlive the winter,
as butterflies, bees, and wasps do.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers appear in great numbers, but they do not
go in swarms as locusts do.</p>

<p>Each grasshopper lives alone. He does nothing for his
neighbor, and his neighbor does nothing for him.</p>

<p>When grasshoppers are numerous they damage the
grass and the young crops.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE ROBBER COUSIN.</p>


<p>The Old Man of the Meadow is, in his way, like a quiet
country gentleman. He roams about the fields,
and likes to sing, and is fond of moonlight. He
likes the shade, and the cool, still places under the
green herbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>He has a fierce cousin, who is a great robber, a kind of
land pirate. His name is <i>locust</i>.</p>

<p>I asked a class of boys, “What is a locust?” One
said: “It is a great, big grasshopper.”</p>

<p>Another said: “It is a greedy grasshopper that eats
everything.”</p>

<p>A third said: “A locust is a grasshopper that travels
in swarms.”</p>

<p>Now these were pretty good answers. Each had some
truth in it. A locust is <i>not</i> a grasshopper.
But it is much like a grasshopper. It is his very
near relative.</p>

<p>The locust is not always larger than the grasshopper.
The great green, or the wart-biter grasshopper, is
larger than the Rocky Mountain locust. That
locust is called “the hateful,” because he does so
much harm.</p>

<p>The locust is generally larger than the grasshopper, and
one very big locust is much larger than any grasshopper
that ever was known. And, too, the locust
is much more greedy.</p>

<p>The locust destroys all plants that come in its way. It
will eat the bark off the trees.</p>

<p>Locusts live and move in swarms. Instead of living
and dying in the places where they were born,
they are given to travel. They migrate like the
birds you will read of in this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>It is not quite surely known what is the motive for
their journeys. Probably it is to get food. The
locust is the child of hot lands. His first home
was, no doubt, in the great sandy plains of Asia.
He is very common in Africa. In Europe and
the eastern part of the United States he is not
very common. In the Western States he has
done much damage.</p>

<p>If you take up a locust to examine, you will at once
notice that his feelers are much shorter than those
of the grasshopper. Mrs. Locust also is without
the sword for placing her eggs. She lays them
in the earth in long tubes.</p>

<p>The front of the locust’s head is harder and thicker
than the grasshoppers. The hind legs are also
much thicker and stronger than even the big
strong ones of the grasshopper.</p>

<p>The locust’s coat is of light brown or sand color.
There is a delicate green tinge on the wings. The
breast has a soft vest of down. The legs are often
striped in bands of brown and yellow.</p>

<p>The locust does not make his music as the grasshopper
does. When he wishes to sing, Mr. Locust stands
on his two front pairs of legs. Then he lifts his
hind legs, and draws them one by one, or both
together, over his wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>The inner side of the hind legs has rough file-like edges.
The wings have thick veins, which stand like cords
above the wing surface.</p>

<p>The file parts of the legs rub on these cords, and produce
the sound. The sound takes different tones,
as one or both legs are used at a time in making
it. Sometimes the sound is very loud, sometimes
it is very low.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the summer, Mrs. Locust lays her
eggs, fifty or one hundred together, in a tube
hidden in the earth. In places where locusts do
much harm, rewards are given for baskets full of
these tubes. Many boys make a living by digging
them from the earth, and selling them to be
destroyed.</p>

<p>For you must know that locusts being very greedy,
and very numerous, do much harm. They move
quickly, and in great swarms. Though they live
in swarms they have no queen as the bees have,
and they do no work as bees and ants do.</p>

<p>Probably there is no living thing seen in such numbers
as the locusts. We can scarcely believe or understand
what we are told about the multitudes of
these insects which appear in the East.</p>

<p>They fill the sky like a great cloud, so that the day is
darkened. When they see a green place, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
settle to feed. In a few minutes the green is all
gone. The place is as brown and bare as if a fire
had swept over it.</p>

<p>People hear with terror that the locusts are coming.
They know the crops will be eaten up. Then food
will be scarce, and the people will be poor.</p>

<p>If by chance a swarm is destroyed by other means than
by fire, all the air for miles will be filled with the
bad smell of the decaying bodies.</p>

<p>The only good that poor people can get from the locusts
is by eating them. They pull off the wings, and
legs, and dry the bodies. They eat them fried in
oil and salt, or ground into meal, after roasting.</p>

<p>The locusts cannot fly against the wind. They go with
the wind. It brings them, and if it changes, it
sweeps them away. Sometimes the wind drives
them out to sea. If they become too weary to fly,
they drop into the waves and are drowned. This
often happens. Then the water washes their
bodies ashore. The coast of Africa has been found
covered thick with them, for the space of fifty
miles.</p>

<p>But they do not always drop into the sea. They are
very strong on the wing. A great swarm of
locusts was met by a ship, twelve hundred miles
from shore. They surrounded the ship, and hid
the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>As their flight is so strong, locusts can go from one
country to another. They pass from Africa to the
south of Europe. They go from the mainland to
the islands.</p>

<p>Usually the locusts fly during the day, while the air is
hot and dry. Late in the day they settle to feed,
and where they stop they stay until all green
things are eaten up. Of course they do not feed
when on the wing. They run along the ground
to eat.</p>

<p>People try many ways of killing locusts. Sometimes
deep trenches are cut, and filled with water, so
that the young unwinged locusts, as they run along
the ground, will fall in and be drowned. But the
locusts are in such numbers that the drowned ones
soon fill the trenches. The others run safely over
the dead bodies.</p>

<p>Sometimes great fires are lit across their path. Then
the hordes of locusts crowd on, and at last, the
fires are put out by the burned bodies. After
that, the others pass on unhurt.</p>

<p>You must know that the young locust is quite as greedy,
and as great a terror as his parents. In the larval
and pupal states, they migrate as well as when they
have wings. They seem born to eat and to travel.
At this stage they go by walking. They march<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
in a solid column like soldiers. They move straight
on, nothing turning them aside. Is a house in the
way? Over it and into it they go. You know
some ants move in swarms in this way.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The locust, being larger, more numerous, and more
greedy than the ants, do much harm. If they find
a town in their path, through it they go. Countless
numbers may be killed, but there are countless
numbers to follow. Is a river in the way? Into
it they tumble, and when enough dead bodies lie
on the water to make a raft, the other locusts pass
safely over.</p>

<p>One great trouble about the locust is, that when a full-grown
swarm passes through a place the ground is
left full of eggs. The next year these hatch, and
the larvæ and pupæ eat up all that has grown
since their parents ravaged the land.</p>

<p>Famines of two or three years duration have been
caused in this way. You will not wonder at the
strength of locusts and the amount of food they
need, when I tell you that one kind is quite a foot
broad from tip to tip of the wings.</p>

<p>The great foreign locusts are very splendid to look
at. They are dressed like soldiers in crimson
and blue. Their fierce eyes shine, and the rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
of their wings makes a sound like the coming
of an army.</p>

<p>Did I not give this locust a good name, when I called
him the robber cousin?</p>

<p class="ph3">THE MERRY COUSINS.</p>


<p>You have heard about the robber cousin of the Old Man
of the Meadow. Now you shall hear about a very
happy and harmless little cousin. Here he is!</p>

<p>Did you ever meet him in your walks? Did he ever
come creeping out of a hole in the wall, or from a
chink in the bricks in the hearth, and sit down by
you before the fire?</p>

<p>Did you notice how he waved his long feelers gently in
the heat, and seemed to bask in the glow as pussy
does? If you were very still, perhaps all at once
he burst into a shrill, gay little song.</p>

<p>Did you notice what a shining, dark-brown coat he
had? Did you see that his tail had two long, stiff
hairs, or bristles, spread out from each other?
Did you think that they were like the long tail
hairs of the bright and dainty May-fly?<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>
<p>When you saw all this did you know your little friend
well? Did you call him by his name, “How are
you, Mr. Cricket”?</p>

<p>Ah, the cricket is a right-jolly little fellow; let us take
a good look at him.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of crickets which we shall talk
about. The house cricket, the field cricket, the
mole cricket.</p>

<p>The body of the cricket is not so slender as that of the
grasshopper, it is short and thick. It is much the
shape of the first joint of your thumb. The color
is a dark, glossy brown, sometimes almost black.</p>

<p>The feelers are very long, longer than the whole body.
The eyes are large and round. The under wings
are very large, much larger than the wing-cases.
When they are folded up, they reach out beyond
the covers and the body, in a long needle-like roll.
It looks as if Mr. Cricket were carrying home
something under his arm.</p>

<p>Near where the wing cover joins his body, Mr. Cricket
has a little, thin drum-head for his music. He
is very fond of making a noise. The French call
him “Cri-cri”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> from the sound he makes. We
call him “cricket” for the same reason.</p>

<p>The cricket has strong jaws, sharp teeth, and a thick
round tongue. His feet are not broad and thick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
like the grasshopper’s. He does not run up plants
as the grasshopper does. The cricket runs about
the ground. He has sharp, thin feet. Sometimes
they have stiff hairs on them.</p>

<p>As he runs about the ground, his long feelers warn him
of any danger in front. What do you think he has
to tell him of danger behind? He has that pair of
long, stiff tail hairs, which look so much like feelers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cricket does not sing. It is Mr. Cricket that
makes all the noise. How does he make it?
He has three strong veins under his left wing
cover. The largest of these is rough, like a file.
This vein he uses as a man uses the bow of a
violin.</p>

<p>When the rough vein is drawn across the right wing
cover, all the cover trembles, or quivers, and gives
out a sound, as when the bow is drawn over the
strings of a violin.</p>

<p>The field cricket will sing all day. The house and
mole crickets sing only at night.</p>

<p>Field crickets and house crickets are very much alike.
The field cricket is darker than the house cricket.
He is also noisy by day. In the winter he creeps
into the earth and is torpid, unless the early cold
kills him.</p>

<p>I think house crickets are field crickets that have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to living in doors. So, in course of time, they have
changed a little. But they were all field crickets
once.</p>

<p>Crickets are fond of moisture. They are thirsty creatures.
They will drink any liquid left in their
way. They drink water, milk, soup, tea, beer,
vinegar, yeast. I have known them to come to my
ink bottle to try to drink the ink! But that killed
them!</p>

<p>Crickets eat vegetables. They like potato. They are
greedy, and will eat whatever is in their way.
They eat bread crumbs, soft grease, and are very
fond of meat. They catch and eat small insects.
They eat leather. Also they will eat woollen cloth,
stockings, clothes.</p>

<p>Once our cook laid upon the grass a large piece of
woollen blanket, on which she had spilled some
bread sponge. She left it there thirty-six hours.
When she went for it, the crickets had eaten
nearly all of it. It was so full of holes it was
like a net. There were more holes than there
was blanket.</p>

<p>Crickets do not like to change their homes. They
prefer to stay near where they were born. If you
carry them away they will use their big wings to
get home. Unless they fly to move from home to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
home, they do not use their big wings very much.
They walk, or hop.</p>

<p>The poets and story-tellers are very fond of crickets.
Many people think it is lucky to have them sing
in the hearth. But there is no luck about it. It
is very pleasant and cheery to hear them sing.</p>

<p>In hot weather the house cricket sometimes goes into the
garden to live. In October he comes in, and finds
a home in the house-wall. He likes new houses
where the mortar is not too hard for him to pull
some of it out and make his little home. He
chooses the kitchen and other well-warmed rooms
to live in.</p>

<p>If the house is shut up and without fires for some days
the cricket becomes torpid. What do you suppose
these little fellows did before they found men to
build houses for them?</p>

<p>In houses they keep quiet all day. They are timid
things. Perhaps they sleep. At night they come out.
One wise old man who wrote about crickets said
that the tiny, new crickets came out on the hearth-stone
by hundreds. They were about the size of
fleas. He found all sizes at the same time. So he
thought that they hatch at any time if they live
in a warm place.</p>

<p>The field cricket makes his house in the earth. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
seeks a hot, sunny spot. Then he digs out a hole
with his strong jaws. This hole is often from six
to twelve inches deep.</p>

<p>The cricket is very timid and runs into his hole if any
one comes by. But if he is not afraid, he sits in
the door of his house to catch insects that come
near. He also eats leaves and grass, that grow
about his door.</p>

<p>Little French children fish for crickets by tying an ant
to a thread and dropping it into the hole. You
can also make Mr. Cricket come out, by poking a
blade of grass into his hole. He runs up to see
what is the matter.</p>

<p>Down in the bottom of the hole, Mrs. Cricket lays her
eggs. They are fastened to each other, and to the
ground by a kind of glue. She lays about three
hundred eggs each year. She does not put them
all in one place.</p>

<p>As soon as the larvæ come out of the eggs, they run up
to the top of the ground. Each one then begins
to dig a new burrow. Now and then they get
tired of a burrow, and go off to make a new one.</p>

<p>The little crickets in the larva and pupa state look
much like the grown ones, only they have no
wings. When they are about half-grown, they
hop about, and look, and act, much like tiny toads.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
If the crickets come out of the egg in July, they
will reach the perfect state the next May.</p>

<p>When they are full grown, they have wings, and can
play a tune. They like that. They sit in their
doors and sing.</p>

<p>In Spain, the people like the cricket’s song so much
that they keep crickets in little cages, to sing for
them. If they have plenty to eat and drink, they
will sing and be happy.</p>

<p>Each cricket will need a cage all for himself. Two
crickets shut up together will fight, until one is
killed. Crickets always live alone.</p>

<p class="ph3">A QUEER CRICKET.</p>


<p>When you are out in the woods, you may find a very
small, brown cricket, in the moist places at the
roots of trees. That is the wood cricket.</p>

<p>The most curious of all the crickets is the mole cricket.
The mole cricket is the stoutest and largest of all
the cricket family. He takes his name from the
little furry, mouse-like animal that burrows in the
ground,—the mole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The mole cricket is something like the mole in shape,
and in the shape of its front feet. It is very like
the mole in its ways.</p>

<p>Mole crickets in the larva and pupa state are like
their parents in looks and habits. They lack only
the wings. The wings of mole crickets are short.
They open and close them at each stroke when
they fly. This makes them fly with a wave-like
motion. Now they go up, now they drop down.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_133" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A HAPPY FAMILY.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The mole cricket sings only at night. It does not
make such loud music as the field cricket.</p>

<p>The most curious thing about the mole cricket is its
front feet. They are broad and short, and have
toes. They look like a mole’s front feet. They
also look like the glove, or hand part, of a little
suit of armor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>These hands are made for digging. The mole cricket
burrows along under the ground as a mole does.
Have you seen the long, low ridge of earth the
mole makes in field or garden? The mole cricket’s
furrow is like that, only much smaller.</p>

<p>The mole cricket eats the roots of vegetables, as he
goes along under ground. He is fond of peas,
beans, and beets. He will eat the roots of flowers,
also. He is a plague in a garden. He likes, also,
to live near a stream or canal. He is very fond
of damp places.</p>

<p>The mole cricket neither flies nor sings by day. If
dug out of his burrow, he seems very stupid and
helpless. At evening, he tries to comfort himself
by a low, jarring song.</p>

<p>The mole cricket has a hard, shell-like body. Its legs
also are horny. For this reason, one of its names
is the “earth crab.” It is of a lighter color than
the other crickets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mole Cricket makes a very pretty nest. It is the
size and shape of half an egg, cut lengthwise. It
is put very near the surface of the ground. Then
the rays of the sun can warm the eggs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cricket makes her nest soft and smooth. Then
she puts into it about one hundred eggs. The
eggs are in a tough skin, not a shell. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
of a gray-yellow color. The earth above the nest
often looks like an ant-hill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cricket does not cease her care for her eggs, when
they are put into the nest. There are some kinds
of beetles that eat these eggs. Mrs. Cricket digs
round and round her nest a network of halls.
She hopes the beetle will get lost when he comes
to look for her eggs.</p>

<p>After the eggs are laid, and the halls are all made,
what do you think Mrs. Cricket does? She sits
in one of her halls. She listens for Mr. Beetle or
any other enemy. When he comes, she runs out
to attack him. She fights so bravely that she
drives him away.</p>

<p>At night, when the mole cricket is flying about, its
body sometimes shines like fire. You know the
firefly shines. But the firefly gives forth its light
in flashes. The glow-worm has a steady light.</p>

<p>The mole cricket does not always shine. But some
have been found to do so. People who have seen
these big, bright things flying in the dark, have
been so foolish as to get frightened.</p>

<p>I hope if you think of being afraid at any time, you
will first make sure what it is that you are afraid
of. The mole cricket is nothing to fear, even
when he shines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>I think the reason that his body has been found to
shine sometimes is this. He spends his time
digging among dead wood and leaves. Sometimes
he digs about dead animals.</p>

<p>Now, no doubt, there are times when in this work his
body gets covered with a fire-shining stuff,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that
comes among dead things. Then when he comes,
fresh from his work, his body glows, and he shines
as he flies. After a little, the shining matter wears
off, and he shines no more.</p>

<p class="ph3">OTHER HOPPERS.</p>


<p>One day, when I was a child, I went to play in a field,
with my brother. I saw that many blades of
grass had little balls of foam on them. My
brother said, “The horses have been eating here;
this froth is from their mouths.”</p>

<p>But when I had looked a little longer, I said, “There
are no horses in this pasture. This grass has not
been bitten.”</p>

<p>A man who came by, said, “Ah, that is cuckoo spit.
The cuckoos dropped it from their mouths.”
When the man had gone, I said, “Our father told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
me we had no cuckoos near here. And birds do
not drop froth from their bills.”</p>

<p>A little French boy, who had followed the man, said,
“How silly that man is! That is frog spit!
Frogs make it, not cuckoos.” I told him, “There
are no frogs in this field. I do not see one. But
the froth is all over the grass.”</p>

<p>“Since no one can suit you,” said my brother, “you
had better find out for yourself.”</p>

<p>Then I took a leaf and laid on it some grass blades
with the foam balls on them. And I gently
opened the balls with a grass stem.</p>

<p>Oh here was a queer sight! Here was a little, live,
pale, green thing. It had two tiny, black eyes,
two little feelers, a body shaped like a three-cornered
wedge.</p>

<p>“See, see!” I cried. “These balls are cradles! The
grasshopper has made these beds for her babies.
Here is a wee grasshopper in each one.”</p>

<p>But it is very easy to be mistaken. I was wrong, too.
For these little things were not grasshoppers, and
they had made their foam balls for themselves.</p>

<p>Looking closer, we saw that the little green thing held
fast by its head to the grass stem.</p>

<p>Then we saw that the foam ball being made of bubbles,
changed and broke. You know bubbles do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
last long. These tiny bubbles slowly broke, and a
clear drop of water ran to the bottom of the ball.</p>

<p>When the drop grew large, it fell off. Then another
formed in its place.</p>

<p>We did not need to think long to be sure that the little
hopper sucked sap, or juice, from the grass. This
sap not only fed it, but ran through its body, and
made its foam cloak, or bed. This kept it safe
and warm.</p>

<p>When we learned more of these things, we found that
these were not grasshoppers. They belong to
another order of insects. I tell you about them
now, lest you make the mistake that I did.</p>

<p>These insects are hoppers. Frog-hoppers some call
them. Their hind legs are very strong. They
make great leaps for their size.</p>

<p>There are a number of odd insects in this order.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> They
are very unlike each other, except in the wings.
It is called the order of the same-wings, because
the upper and under wings are alike. Only the
upper ones are longer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>
<p>In this order you will find some of the fireflies. You
know them. They fly about over the grass on
summer nights. They make pretty little fireworks
for you, before you go to bed.</p>

<p>The little aphis, which spoils the roses, is of this order.
You know the ants keep the aphis for their cow,
and eat the sweet juice it makes.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>We will look at only two of this family. We want
to know a little about this wee frog-hopper. And
we will learn a little about his biggest cousin, the
cicada, or “the singer.”</p>

<p>The hoppers have, also, a queer little cousin, the scale
bug. The hopper draws out the plant sap, and
covers its body with water. The scale bug turns
the same sap into white dust. It covers its funny
little body all over with flour!</p>

<p>Frog-hoppers are small insects. They have long feelers.
They have only two joints in their feet. The frog-hopper
has a big eye on each side of its head. It
has, also, three simple eyes set on the top of its
head, like this &#9964;</p>

<p>All the hoppers live on plant juice. The little ones are
very greedy. The mother lays her tiny eggs in
the plant. When the larvæ come out they fasten
their mouths on the skin of the plant, and begin
to suck sap.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>
<p>This bite of the hopper often makes ugly brown holes,
or ridges, come on plants. Often the plants become
sickly, and die, from loss of sap. The hoppers
are not good friends of the plants, as the bees,
ants, wasps, and birds are.</p>

<p>The largest of the same-wing order is the cicada.
Did you ever hear him sing? Mrs. Cicada is
quiet. Her mate sings all day. The hotter it is,
and the drier, the more he sings. In all lands he
is named from his noise, “the singer,” “the
screamer,” “the squealer.”</p>

<p>The cicada is a dry, horny insect. He will keep well in
a cabinet. He lives in trees. Mrs. Cicada has
no music, but she has a sharp knife. How does
she use that?</p>

<p>We might as well call her knife an awl, or a gimlet, for
it is like all three. It is used to cut, or bore, a hole
in the tree. Into the hole she puts her eggs.</p>

<p>This tool which Mrs. Cicada carries has three blades.
The outer ones are rough on the edges. They can
cut into very hard wood. Mrs. Cicada takes hold
of the tree bark with her front feet. Then she
cuts away with her knife, until she has made a
neat little furrow.</p>

<p>She chooses a dead branch for this. The sap in a live
branch would harm her eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>When the larvæ come out of the eggs, they at once
leave the hole, and drop to the ground. There
they dig a little house for a home. Their fore
feet are well made for digging.</p>

<p>Underground they feed on roots. They change from
larvæ to pupæ. Next summer they come up, full-grown.
Then Mr. Cicada begins his song. Mrs.
Cicada at once goes to work to cut holes for her
eggs.</p>

<p>When, in mid-summer, the shrill song of the cicada is
heard, people say: “Ah, now it will be hot and
dry!” The poets have always loved the cicada,
and made many pretty songs and stories about
him.</p>

<p class="ph3">REAL LIVE FAIRY.</p>


<p>One September morning I took Hermie, and went over
the hill, to the windmill. The hillside was
covered with wild carrot, golden-rod, asters, white,
purple, and pink. Near the windmill was a late
wild-rose, in full bloom.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp30" id="i_142" style="max-width: 14.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE LIGHT BRIGADE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Right in the golden centre of the rose, on the stamens
and pistils, I saw what might be two fine jewels,
and the coiled-up spring of a fairy watch. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
ground, among the rose-leaves, lay four lovely
fans, in black and
gold. They looked
as if the fairy-queen
and her
court ladies might
have dropped
them, as they came
home late from a
ball.</p>

<p>I put all these things
on a piece of white
paper. Then I sat
on a stone, took
out my microscope,
and said to Hermie,
“Look here!”</p>

<p>“O!” cried Hermie,
“these are the
head and wings of
a poor butterfly!
But where is his
body gone?”</p>

<p>“A bird has eaten it,”
I said; “see, the
bird’s bill has taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
in the body and clipped off the wings, and
just missed the head, which has dropped off. These
are not the relics of a fairy ball, but of a cruel
murder.”</p>

<p>“I do not see,” said Hermie, “how a butterfly, which
flits so fast, could be picked up so.”</p>

<p>We looked about the leaves of a wild-carrot, and, on
the under side of two or three, safe from the wet,
we found a cluster of pale greenish eggs. “See,”
I said, “the bird dipped down, and picked up the
butterfly, while it was clinging to the leaf, laying
its eggs.</p>

<p>“Or, perhaps the eggs were all laid, and the butterfly
was resting on the bush. Many of these insects
die, soon after the eggs are laid. When the eggs
are safely placed, the insect seems to feel tired and
dull.”</p>

<p>Then we looked at the black and yellow wings through
the microscope. “See all these little scales and
plumes!” said Hermie. “They lie thick as a
bird’s feathers! Once I put a butterfly in a box.
When I let him out, the box was all dusted over
with gold dust. But the butterfly did not look
<i>bare</i>. He seemed as well dressed as ever.”</p>

<p>Then we looked at the head. “What big eyes!” said
Hermie, “and that curled-up thing is his mouth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
I have seen him drinking with it out of flowers.
I do think butterflies are the prettiest things that
are made!”</p>

<p>Many persons think the butterflies are the most beautiful
of all the insects. Next to the beetles they are
the most numerous order. They have, also, been
the most studied. Let us look at them a little.</p>

<p>The butterflies belong to the great order of the scale-wings.
To this order belong two groups of very
beautiful insects. We will look at them. They
are the butterflies and the moths.</p>

<p>The butterflies are insects of the day. The moths are
generally insects of the night. Even when the
moths fly by day they can be easily known from
the butterflies. The butterfly always has a knob
or a point on the end of his horns. The ends of
the moth’s horns are pointed.</p>

<p>When the butterfly is at rest, his wings are held up
and laid flat against each other. Thus the top
sides are hidden, and the under sides show. His
wings are called vans.</p>

<p>The moth rests with his wings folded along his body
or laid out flat. They cling close to what he rests
upon. If they bend at all, they bend downward,
not upward. The body of the moth is shorter and
thicker, more wedge-shaped, than that of the butterfly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Now, for a look at our butterfly. The head is small
and moves freely. It is not set in a socket to the
body, but held by a little neck. On each side of
the head is a great, bright eye with many thousand
facets, or surfaces.</p>

<p>At the back of the head of a butterfly are generally
two small, simple eyes. These are usually hidden
under long hairs. Do you see the soft hairs which
clothe all the butterfly’s body? For you must notice
that the butterfly wears an elegant, soft, velvet
coat of fine hairs. This coat is usually black
or brown. But it has often stripes or spots of a
lighter color.</p>

<p>On the top of the head the butterfly carries a pair of
many-jointed horns. As I told you, the ends of
these are little knobs.</p>

<p>The chief part of the mouth of the butterfly is a tube,
called a trunk. Did you ever notice the big trunk
of an elephant? The butterfly’s trunk is small.
It is coiled up like a watch-spring when it is not
in use. The butterfly can unroll it. It is so slim
he can thrust it into the longest and narrowest
flower cups.</p>

<p>Really this trunk is made of two pieces with little
points upon them. These two parts lie together
and seem one. Between them the honey is drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
up. You must know that butterflies live chiefly
on honey. It is not likely that they take much
other kind of food, but they are fond of water.
Have you seen them in damp places?</p>

<p>When the fine trunk of the butterfly is curled up it is
kept safe by two hairy pieces which grow on the
front of the head.</p>

<p>The butterfly has six legs that grow from the chest part
of its body. But the butterfly is not a walking
insect. Bees, wasps, ants, and beetles, you know,
walk a great deal. Butterflies rarely use their
legs for anything but standing when they eat
or rest. They move only by flying.</p>

<p>The wings are made of two thin skin-pieces laid upon a
framework of nerves or veins. They are covered
with a double layer of scales. The edge scales are
long and fringe-like. The upper and under sides
of the wings differ in color.</p>

<p>The upper wings are widest. They have smooth edges,
and are of a triangle-shape. The lower wings are
rounded. They have waved or pointed edges.
Sometimes they have two long points like tails.</p>

<p>The body of the butterfly is made in rings, but they are
soft, not horny like those of a dragon-fly. The
body is slender and has no weapon. It has no
sting to fight, and no saw to cut wood to make a
place for its eggs.</p>

</figure>

<p>The butterfly is the chief
partner of the flowers.
Its long, slim drinking
tube helps it to dip far
into a flower’s throat.
As it reaches in, it gets
the stamen pollen well
upon it. Then, since
the butterfly rarely
walks about, as the beetles
do, it is not likely
to waste the pollen by
rubbing it off where it is
not wanted.</p>

<p>Not only is the butterfly
the flower’s best partner,
but it wears the gay colors
of the flowers. Once
I was walking in a garden
with a very little boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
A flight of yellow butterflies came over a tulip
bed. “See! see!” cried the child, “the flowers
are loose, and are flying away!” Poets, as well
as children, have called the butterflies “flying
flowers.”</p>

<p>In very early times, people began to study butterflies.
It was not only their number or their beauty
which made people notice them. It was the
wonder of their changes, from egg to full-grown
insect.</p>

<p>Who would think that this splendid thing, which
scorns to use its feet, and lives on the wing in the
clear air, was once a worm, crawling on many
legs, among the grasses and leaves?</p>

<p>Who would think that this dainty creature, which
drinks dew and honey, once spent all its days,
chewing and gnawing leaves as the earthworm
does?</p>

<p>Who would think that these bright wings, which are
so crisp and stiff that they never bend or wrinkle
even by a single fold, were once like little flat
buds, inside a crawling caterpillar, or bound up
in the tight, horny pupa case?</p>

<p>Let us follow the journey of these little greenish eggs,
stuck on the under side of a carrot leaf. Let us
follow them up their curious way, until we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
them sitting on the heart of a rose, as on a throne
of gold, and then suddenly sailing off among the
sunbeams!</p>

<p>Each kind of butterfly prefers some especial plant, on
which the caterpillar feeds. On this plant the
eggs are laid. Some butterflies like oaks best;
some cabbage; some choose plants of the carrot
family for a home.</p>

<p>The butterfly which we will now hear about is the
“swallow-tail.” It is one which likes fennel and
wild carrot. It lays its eggs on the under side of
the leaf of one of these plants. The eggs are
placed in little patches. They are of a greenish
color, and nearly round. The eggs of some other
butterflies are of very odd shapes.</p>

<p>The first eggs of the swallow-tail butterfly are laid in
May. In eight or ten days the eggs turn nearly
black. Then out comes the little caterpillar. The
first thing he does is to turn around and eat up
his shell! Next he begins to eat carrot leaf. He
grows, and in a few days casts his skin.</p>

<p>The caterpillar keeps on growing. To get more room
he sheds his skin. He eats the cast-off skin each
time. He is a very pretty caterpillar. His color
is bright green. On each of his twelve rings he
has a black band. On each black band there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
gay, yellow spots. He is about an inch and a half
long when full grown.</p>

<p>There is a queer thing about this caterpillar. If you
touch him, while he eats, he runs out a little
forked horn from behind his head. He seems to
want to frighten you! When you let him alone
he draws in his horns. These horns can emit a
strong smell.</p>

<p>His feet are made with rings and hairs, so that he can
creep safely along the plants where he feeds. His
mouth is weak, so he can eat only soft leaves. In
about two weeks he has eaten all that he needs.</p>

<p>Then he creeps up a plant stem and spins a strong silk
rope. He binds this rope about his body and the
plant stem. That ties him fast. The caterpillars
of several kinds, which tie themselves in this way
for the pupa state, are called girdle caterpillars,
or belted caterpillars. He is also held fast by the
tail as well as by this body belt. When he is
tied, his body shortens and thickens. His caterpillar
skin bursts, and drops off.</p>

<p>He is now a pupa. The pupa skin hardens into a
little case. Now he neither moves nor eats.</p>

<p>How long is he a pupa? That depends upon the time
of year. In spring, two weeks are enough for the
change. In hot summer, nine days or a week will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
do. If it is cold autumn weather, the pupa will
not change to a full-grown insect until the next
spring.</p>

<p>If in the winter you find a pupa tied to a weed, and
bring it into a hot-house, or a warm room, in
a few days you will have a fine butterfly out.
A wise man, who studied butterflies, put some
pupæ in a very cold place, and they did not
change for two or three years!</p>

<p>When it is time for the insect to come out of the pupa
case, some motions like deep breathing are made.
These crack open the hard skin. Then the insect
pulls itself out. It is moist and weak. Its wings
droop a little.</p>

<p>The new butterfly breathes hard, many times. At
each breath air rushes through its body, and
through the tubes of its wings. The frame of its
wings stiffens and fills out. The body and legs
grow dry and firm.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Then the new-made butterfly rests a little,—perhaps
for several hours. After that it seems to feel fine.
It can move its wide wings! It can fly! It sails
away!</p>

<p>Now it lights on a great white head of wild carrot, or
on a rose. Let us look at it. Its wings are black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and yellow. The black is in bands and streaks.
It has six bluish spots on each lower wing, and
one large red and blue spot. Its body is like
black velvet. Each lower wing has a long, beautiful,
curved tail.</p>

<p>The butterfly is an insect with far more beauty than
sense. We may say it is an insect with very little
brains. It has none of the wise ways of the ant,
wasp, bee or spider; it only flies and eats, and
lays eggs. It builds no house, stores no food,
takes no care of its young.</p>

<p>The butterfly can see. It has wonderful eyes. It can
hear. It can smell. It can taste. Its flower
partners spread out for it their finest colors, perfumes,
and honey drops.</p>

<p class="ph3">LIFE AMONG SNOW AND ROSES.</p>


<p>I told you that the butterfly did no work, built no
house, and showed very little sense. That is true
of the full-grown butterfly. He seems so pleased
with his wings that he does nothing but enjoy them.</p>

<p>But you must know that the caterpillar is only one
state of the butterfly, and there are caterpillars
which build for themselves very curious houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp26" id="i_153" style="max-width: 12.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_153.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A FROSTY MORNING.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are caterpillars which
leave the egg in the
autumn. They live as
caterpillars all winter,
and enter the pupa state
in the spring. Let us
watch them, as they live
with the snow-flakes flying
about them. Then
we will watch them to
the time of roses.</p>

<p>Many butterflies lay their
eggs singly. They put
one egg alone, on the tip
of a willow, hazel, poplar,
or oak leaf. Other butterflies
put their eggs in
small clusters on the underside
of carrot, nettle,
or blackberry leaves.
Some put eggs in a ring,
around an elm or birch
twig.</p>

<p>Now and then you find the
eggs in a chain or pyramid,
hanging upon a leaf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
There are, also, some butterflies which drop their
eggs on the ground among the grasses, or on the
lower parts of grass blades.</p>

<p>In all cases the caterpillar feeds on the plant on which
he is hatched from the egg. When he is ready to
come out of the egg all he has to do is to bite a
hole in his shell and crawl forth. Then, at once,
he begins to eat.</p>

<p>He may begin at the tip of the leaf, and eat up to the
mid-vein on both sides. He is careful not to bite
the mid-vein. When he has had a full meal, he
goes and lies along the mid-vein to rest. Then,
when rested, he eats again. Many do this, but
not all.</p>

<p>When one leaf is finished, he takes the next one on the
twig. After the first leaf he is not so careful to
begin at the tip. He just bites out pieces anywhere,
but he does not bite the big vein. Perhaps
it is too hard. Perhaps he knows he must have it
for a roadway.</p>

<p>Do you remember what you read in the First Nature
Reader about the spider, which has in her body
little knobs for spinning silk?<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The caterpillar
has a silk-spinner. It is in the underside of his
head. It is a little tube in the shape of a cone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>
<p>Did you ever notice the queer way a caterpillar has of
wagging his head from side to side? He acts as
if in great pain. But he is not in pain. He is
only laying down a silk web with that motion.</p>

<p>It is by means of this silk that the caterpillar makes
his home. Let us look at him while he works.
He fastens his line to the edge of a leaf. Then he
carries it to the other edge, or to the next leaf.
Then another line, and so on. Each line is a little
shorter than the one before. This bends the leaf.
At last it is bent into a tube, or box, or several
leaves are bound into a bower.</p>

<p>The caterpillar bites a notch, or line, in the tip of the
leaf to make it bend over for a roof. Is not that
cunning? Think how strange it is, that a tiny
thing, just out of the egg, away up alone on a tree,
should know how to build this pretty house!</p>

<p>The caterpillar of the swallow-tail chooses a leaf for a
home, weaves a silk carpet over it, and lies along
the mid-vein. What do you think he does on
rainy days, when the water begins to take his bent
leaf for a spout or gutter?</p>

<p>He builds a second floor of silk, a little higher up,
between the edges of the leaf. That makes a nice,
dry, silk hammock. There he lies, while the water
ripples along the mid-vein below him. I suppose
the sound of the water sings him to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>A caterpillar which makes a bag of a nettle leaf, for a
nest, lies in it so snug that he is too lazy to go out
for food. So he eats up his roof for his dinner!
Another caterpillar draws a leaf together into a
pretty little pocket. He weaves silk over it, outside
and in, and then,—he eats up this dear little
home, and has to make another!</p>

<p>These caterpillars make their homes for summer.
There are some which need winter homes. The
caterpillar of the Viceroy butterfly is only half-grown
when winter comes. He lives in a willow-tree.
He makes his warm winter house of a
willow leaf.</p>

<p>How does he do it? He eats part of the leaf away
to the mid-vein. Then he bends the lower part
together, with silk. He fastens the edges tight
and lines the inside with silk. Then he covers the
outside with silk, and binds the nest to the twig
with a silk thread, by crawling around and around,
drawing the silk with him.</p>

<p>The fierce winter storms will not tear off this house,
which he has bound to the tree. The silk he uses
is of a brown, dry-leaf color. When the house is
made, he crawls in, head first. The knobbed hind
end of his body fills up the open part of the nest.
Did you ever hear of caterpillars called “woolly-bears,”
because of their furry bodies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>This caterpillar has a little cousin, who makes his
winter home of a bent birch leaf. The color of
his silk, and the knobbed end of his body, are just
the gray-purple of young birch buds. So, in the
spring, no bird notices him. Thus, while the snow
flies, these caterpillars lie safe in their warm
homes. They are torpid.</p>

<p>Early in the spring they become pupæ, and then butterflies.
Some butterflies pass the winter as eggs,
some as caterpillars, some as pupæ. Some butterflies
have two or more broods in the summer.
Thus we have new butterflies every week.</p>

<p>Full-grown butterflies sometimes live over winter.
They come out in the spring, looking rather shabby,
and with the edges of their wings broken. When
frost comes, they creep into some crack, or under
a piece of tree-bark, or down among the roots. As
they lay their wings flat against each other, a
small crevice will hold them.</p>

<p>But the glad time of the butterflies is in the summer,
when they have wings, honey, and sunshine. Some
live from May until September. Some come out
in April, and live only through May. Some wait
until July and August. Others come for a little
time in the spring, and a second brood in October.
Of these many lie torpid in cracks over winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>At night, and during rainy days, butterflies hide, as
they do in cold weather. They seldom fly abroad
before nine in the morning. Between four and five
in the afternoon they begin to steal off to bed.
They are out in full force in those bright, hot
noon hours, when the flowers are at their best.
Happy butterfly, he flits about in the sun and
drinks honey all the time of roses!</p>

<p>Many butterflies live alone. But some seem to go in
what we call a swarm. A “flight” of butterflies
is a better name for many together than “a
swarm.” It is more common to see a number of
caterpillars together than many butterflies. The
large, gay-colored butterflies are generally seen
only by one, two, or three, at a time.</p>

<p>No doubt you have seen a piece of damp ground, which
looks as if it had burst into blossom, so many
yellow butterflies have lit upon it. They are fond
of moisture.</p>

<p>Orange-and-black butterflies have been seen to settle
on a dead bush, and cover its branches like gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
leaves. They hang, in
such a case, with their
wings folded against
each other, and their
backs down. They
do not cling one to
another, as bees, when
they swarm.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp68" id="i_159" style="max-width: 115.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">AS NIGHT DRAWS NEAR.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A gentleman saw a great
number of blue-spotted
butterflies, rising from
some low pine-trees,
where they seemed to have spent the night.
Another gentleman saw a very great swarm of
the orange-and-black butterfly, which hovers about
the milk-weed. Hundreds of small, copper-red
butterflies sometimes light together on a hot, dusty
road. Even the fine swallow-tails have been seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
in numbers together, when attracted by the honey
and perfume of a lilac-bush.</p>

<p>Some butterflies eat less than others, and spend much
time sitting in the sun, opening and shutting their
vans or wings. They seem very fond of play.
You will see them whirling about, and chasing
each other, like children at a good game.</p>

<p>Some butterflies have a way of flying at whatever they
see in motion. If you toss a glove, ball, or little
basket, into the air, they dart at it. They seem
curious to know what it is. Did you ever see a
little copper-colored butterfly, with black spots,
darting at a big beetle or grasshopper?</p>

<p>These little fellows seem to lie in wait under the
leaves, and rush out at whatever goes by, just as
little dogs dash out from gate-ways!</p>

<p>Let us now talk a little about the colors of butterflies.
The upper and under sides of the wings often
differ much. The upper side is much brighter than
the under side. Do you see a reason for this?</p>

<p>The insect flies with the wings spread out in full view.
Its flight is not even and straight. It moves in
jerks, called “flitting,” and it dashes here and
there, zig-zag. This way of flying makes it very difficult
for a bird to pick up a butterfly on the wing.</p>

<p>Thus the pretty insect is safe enough when he flies.
But it would be easy to pick him up when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
he lights. So the upper side of his wings shows
most of his beauty, and the under side, which
only is shown when he rests, is shaded like a
dry leaf, or is of the hue of the plants upon which
he often sits.</p>

<p>Not only is the butterfly protected by the graver color
of the under side of its vans, but it wears the
general flower-color of the season, or of its home.</p>

<p>In spring, you know how many of the flowers are blue,
or partly blue. The violets, the hyacinths, the
purple crocus, the liverwort, and many more, are
blue, and among them fly blue butterflies. There
are more blue ones in spring, than at any other
time of year.</p>

<p>Also, in spring, there are many yellow butterflies. You
will hardly be able to distinguish them at first
glance, from the buttercups, dandelions, crocuses,
and cowslips, upon which they rest.</p>

<p>The little butterflies, which love the dusky woods, are
brown, drab, and gray, with black or reddish spots,
and dull, yellow marks. Their coats are like the
colors of the tree trunks, the mosses, and dead
leaves, where they live.</p>

<p>Then when the daisies and lilies are wide out, with the
white roses and bright-hued summer flowers, come
the white butterflies. With them follow the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
splendid swallow-tail family, to swing around the
tulips and gladiolas, and petunias, yellow lilies,
and geraniums.</p>

<p>In the autumn, among the marigolds, dahlias, and
asters, all our gayest-coated butterflies come out,—orange,
gold, brown, scarlet, purple,—eyed like
peacocks’ tails.</p>

<p>You must not think from this, that you will see <i>only</i>
such and such colored butterflies, at certain times
of year. You may see swallow-tails very early in
spring. They have lived over winter.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> You may
see in autumn the second brood of spring butterflies.
You may find the autumn butterflies sailing
about in the summer. They have lived over
winter as caterpillars.</p>

<p>A little lad said to me, one day, when he saw a very
gay peacock butterfly, “I think Nature got tired of
painting, and emptied her whole paint-box on that
fellow!” Indeed, it does seem as if there is no
gay tint of earth, or sky, or sea, no hue of flower,
or rainbow, which the butterfly does not wear.</p>

<p>They come to us in red, purple, green, blue, white,
black. They take all shades of these colors. Then
the colors are put on in lines, dots, streaks, bars,
spots, fringes. They are made more beautiful by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the waved line of the lower wings, by the velvet
body, the slender legs, the graceful feelers, the
bright, jewel-like eyes.</p>

<p>No silk dyer can bring out a new shade, but some
butterfly has worn it for his every-day clothes,
since the creation. No king can buy any richer
colors, or more finely put together, than our butterfly
wears. And all else about him sets off the
splendor of Joseph’s coat.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the great order of the scale-wings, the butterfly is
of the family of the “club-horns.” His cousin,
the moth, is of the family of the “varied-horns.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
The feelers of the butterfly, up to the club, are
straight and smooth. The feelers of the moth are
curved and often fringed. If you put them under
a strong microscope, you might think you were
looking at lovely ferns.</p>

<p>Do you remember what you read in the first and second
book of Nature Readers, of the hook-wing family?
Almost all moths have a hook and catch to fasten
the lower wing to the upper one in flight. No
butterfly has such a hook.</p>

<p>I shall now tell you about cousin moth. He is the
night flyer, with the big, thick body, the furry
coat, the fancy feelers, the hook for his wings.
He is the flyer that rests with his wings laid open
and flat, or laid close down along the sides of his
body, like a cloak.</p>

<p>The moth often flies by day. He has lovely, painted
wings, but they do not <i>gleam</i> as do those of the
butterfly.</p>

<p>“I do not want to hear about moths,” said a little girl;
“I know all about <i>them</i>. I kill all I can see. I
killed a big, white one, last night. They do so
much harm. They ate up my mother’s best
muff!”</p>

<p>“And did you kill the tiny, silvery-looking moth, which
was flying close to the carpet? He is a little fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
who when he lights, is folded into a roll, not
so long as the nail of your little finger.”</p>

<p>“No,” says the little girl; “he is too little to do any
harm. I let him alone.”</p>

<p>“Alas! my child. How easy it is, in this world, to be
mistaken! How often the innocent suffer for the
guilty! That silent, white creature, looking like
the ghost of a lily, never has done any harm.
That little silver roll is the meddler, who, in his
early days, ate up your mother’s muff! Come, I
see you know nothing about moths.”</p>

<p>As we sat on the porch, last night, some one said, “Who
ever before saw a humming-bird flying at night?
There is one now, at the honey-suckles.” No! it
was not a humming-bird, but a large hawk-moth.
He hung poised on his quivering wings, unrolled
his long trunk, thrust it deep into a flower, and
drank honey.</p>

<p>It was hard to distinguish him from a humming-bird.
Then, as he dashed across a moonlit space, he
looked like the swallows we had watched at
sunset.</p>

<p>The hawk-moths are large, with large furry bodies.
They have a swift, bird-like flight. One of the
largest is called the “death’s head.” He is furry,
even to his wings and legs. On his shoulders he
has black and white marks, like a skull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>The caterpillar of this moth is the largest of caterpillars.
It is four inches long, and as thick as a man’s finger.
Its color is green, gray, and yellow, with
black dots. It lives on potato-vines. It has bluish
stripes on the sides.</p>

<p>If you find one, you can raise a moth from it. You
must keep it in a dark place, give it potato leaves
to eat, and some moist earth to burrow in. For
this caterpillar hides in the ground, to spend his
pupa days. The pupa case looks, I think, much
like a sea-shell.</p>

<p>A queer thing about this moth is, that it can squeak.
If you touch its feet, with a bit of stick, it seems
angry. It crouches down, and gives a squeak.
No one knows how it makes this noise.</p>

<p>Another curious moth is the wasp moth. It is a day-flyer.
It loves the hottest noons. It does not
look much like a moth. It looks like a wasp, or
hornet. Its body is slim, and has yellow and black
bands. Its wings have very few scales. The
wings are thin and clear, like those of a wasp.</p>

<p>These wasp moths live about trees and shrubs. They
lay their eggs under the bark.</p>

<p>The caterpillars are able to eat wood. They gnaw the
wood for food, and so dig their way into the trees,
and live there. When they have eaten all they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
want, they have made a nice little hole in the
tree. They line it with silk. Then they fall
asleep in their pupa state.</p>

<p>When they are ready to come out, they do not leave
their hard pupa case in the tree. They need it to
protect their wings, as they creep out. When they
get to the door of the hole, they pull their bodies
out of the case. Then they fly off, and leave the
pupa case sticking in the hole.</p>

<p>The most useful moth, one worth all the rest, is the
bombyx. He made your mother’s silk dress, and
your hair ribbon. “What!” Well, did you never
hear of the silk-worm? The silk-worm is the
caterpillar of a moth.</p>

<p>This is a dull, plain, little insect. Its trunk is very
short, in fact, it is almost gone, for this moth never
eats. It is very short-lived. All it lives for is to
lay a great many hundred eggs.</p>

<p>These eggs are laid on mulberry trees. The caterpillar
soon hatches from the egg. It is a small, homely
thing. It eats much during thirty days. In one
thing it is different from all other caterpillars. It
has a much better silk-spinner in its head. It
makes a great deal of strong, yellow silk. Its
body seems full of the sticky stuff, which, when it
is drawn out, hardens into silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Of this silk the caterpillar spins its cocoon. It spins
hundreds of yards of fine, silk thread. Then it
wraps itself in a cocoon and casts off its caterpillar
skin. If left alone in the cocoon, it eats its way
out, when it has become a full-grown moth.</p>

<p>You must ask your mother or teacher to tell you how
this ball of silk is turned into ribbons and dresses.</p>

<p>From the moth which makes silk for our clothes, let us
turn to the moth which eats up our fur and woollen
clothes. The name of this little plague is <i>Tinea</i>.
You might as well call him <i>tiny</i>, for he is the least
of all moths. He looks as harmless as possible.</p>

<p>He is a mere little silvery, fringy roll, hiding in shady
places, or flitting low and silently on his little gray
wings.</p>

<p>But little Mrs. Tiny, whose name <i>tinea</i> means that she
is a spoiler of things, lays hundreds of eggs. She
hides her eggs in carpets, curtains, furniture, and
clothes. As soon as the little caterpillar is out of
the egg, it proceeds to gnaw what it is lying on.</p>

<p>This small creature bites and pulls out hairs, or threads,
and weaves for itself a nice little rainbow case.
As it grows larger, it builds more case with more
threads. As these hairs or threads are stolen out
of our best things, soon we find great holes in our
coats and gowns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Shake the clothes, and out fall hundreds of little larvæ,
or wee caterpillars. When the case is all finished
the caterpillar likes to hang it up by the closed
end. Then he hangs in it head downward, as a
pupa. The case looks like a little roll of dust and
fuzz. But the fuzzy end is the head of little <i>tinea</i>,
living out his pupa days.</p>

<p>I suppose you have seen great cobweb-like nests,
hanging on plum, cherry, and apple trees. You
have heard them called “worm nests.” You
have seen that they are full of brown caterpillars,
about an inch long.</p>

<p>If you had looked at the twigs of these trees, just after
the leaves fall in the autumn, you might have
thought some fairy had been putting belts and
bracelets upon them. Around the twigs were
little even bands of beads. These beads were the
eggs of a moth.</p>

<p>As soon as the caterpillars come out of these eggs, they
unite in spinning their large silken nests, or tents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
There they live together, until they have grown
to nearly full size. Then they bite holes in the
nest and travel off, each its own way.</p>

<p>When the caterpillar is full-grown, it spins a nice, thin,
clear cocoon, and powders it all over with yellow
dust.</p>

<p>When the moth comes out, it has yellowish wings with
brown bands. It appears in July, and at once
goes off to the orchards. There, in the autumn,
it lays its eggs in rings around the twigs. This
moth rests with its wings folded against its body
like a cloak. Many moths fold their wings cloak-wise,
instead of spreading them out flat, when
they rest.</p>

<p>There is a very beautiful large moth, which has a curious
caterpillar, about which I must tell you.
Whenever this caterpillar changes his skin, he
puts on a new color. At first he is black, and so
hairy that he looks like a little hedgehog. His
next skin is a gray-green, with jet-black hairs
and dots. The third skin is light green, with
five rows of black dots, a number of clear, yellow
spots, and two splendid red spots, like buttons.</p>

<p>The fourth coat is blue, with black and red buttons.
Then his last coat is green, with orange buttons.
He now spins a cocoon. It is double. The outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
is tough and skin-like. The inner part is of softest
silk. This caterpillar is found in the south.</p>

<p>I should like you to see the caterpillars of the sphinx
moth eating. This moth gets its name from an
odd way the caterpillar has of resting. It lifts up
about half of its body, and holds it stiff, and quite
still. People think it looks like a great stone
image in Egypt called the sphinx.</p>

<p>The sphinx moth lays its eggs on the top sprays of a
weed called the spurge. This weed has a milky
juice. The seed grows in a little nut-like pod or
case. The caterpillar of the sphinx hatches from
the egg among the tender green top leaves.
These will make its food. At once it begins to
eat. It grows fast. As it is greedy, and likes
spurge, it eats up all the plant but the roots.</p>

<p>The caterpillar eats the plant from the top down.
When it comes to a seed pod it seems to say,
“Now for a treat!” It sits up in its funny way,
and takes a seed case between its front feet, as a
monkey would hold a nut in its paws. It holds
the pod against its mouth with its front feet, and
gnaws away at it, until it is all gone.</p>

<p>When one plant is stripped bare, off the caterpillars go
to another. There they begin at the lower leaves,
and eat upward. The lower leaves are coarse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
hard. Why do they eat them? Why do they not
climb up for better leaves?</p>

<p>Do you not see the wisdom of this habit, which has
been fixed in these little creatures? If they
climbed up, and ate the top leaves, their little
brothers up there would have nothing to eat
when they came from the egg. Then they would
starve.</p>

<p>If you poke one of these caterpillars, while it is eating,
it seems to be very angry. It spits out a quantity
of green, ill-smelling juice. But the sphinx caterpillars
are pretty, if they have not very good manners.
They are black, or dark green, with crimson
lines like ribbons on them. They are dotted all
over with spots like pearls.</p>

<p>They are full-grown in July. Then they creep into the
ground for their pupa state. They lie there, shut
up in shell-like cases. In a few weeks, out come
the moths. Very early in the day, or late in the
afternoon, you may see them flying about honey-bearing
plants.</p>

<p>This moth is very pretty. It has large wings of a rose
color, with black and green wavy bands. There
are two broods of them each season. The caterpillars
come in June and September. At the end
of September, the last brood of caterpillars hides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
in the ground to spend the winter in the pupa
state.</p>

<p>All moths that fly in the evening are attracted by
light. If you wish to see what very beautiful
creatures they are, set some plates on a table
around a bright light. Have some glasses ready,
and open the window, or outside door. You will
do well to have some ether and some cotton wool.</p>

<p>In come the moths! As they blunder about the light,
it is easy to catch them gently, and put them on a
plate under a glass. Then put in a bit of wool
wet with ether, and they will soon be dead. Or,
you can look at them awhile, and then let them
go. If a moth falls on the velvet or woollen table-cover,
you will see the cloth covered with gold
dust. These tiny dust grains are his scales.</p>

<p>You will wonder at the beauty of these insects. They
have silver and gold gleams. Even the smallest
are lovely. Many of them are dressed in pea-green
and silver, or rose-pink, with red, black, and
brown lines, and fringes. Some are lemon or
orange color. I have found very lovely little
moths, clinging to the window panes, early in the
morning.</p>

<p>The moths of tropic lands are very large, and very
splendid in their colors. I do not think they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
prettier than many of those in our own land.
Our moon moth has long tails, even longer and
more curved than those of the swallow-tail butterfly.
It is of a delicate cream color, with pink
spots.</p>

<p>Now, I will tell you how to catch night-flying moths, if
you wish to make a collection. But do not take
more than one or two of a kind. It is cruel to
waste life.</p>

<p>A collection of moths is hard to keep, their bodies are
so soft and large.</p>

<p>If you wish to catch night moths, take some brown
sugar and boil it to a thick syrup. Put in it some
peppermint, or rose water, or vanilla, to make it
smell nice. Soak some white rags in it. Then
lay the rags in a bowl. Put plenty of pins on
your sleeve. Have some boxes to put the moths
in, and some ether to kill them.</p>

<p>You should have your <i>net</i> also. You know a net to
catch insects is a bag of lace, or fine netting,
sewed on a hoop with a handle. You need a short
handle in the night-moth net.</p>

<p>Go to a clump of trees, and pin the sugared rags on
the trunks. When you have pinned on all you
wish, turn about, and go to the trees where you
put the rags. Have your lantern also. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
will see dozens of moths feasting on the sugar in
the rags. You can catch as many as you like, and
put them in your boxes.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BIRD.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_175.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">ON THE WING.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A bird is an animal which comes from an egg, wears
feathers, and is built for flying. Even the few
birds which run, and do not fly, are all built on
the general plan of flyers.</p>

<p>An egg was described in lesson seven of this book.
All of you have seen plenty of eggs. The eggs of
birds are usually hatched by the mother-bird sitting
upon them for a certain number of days, or
weeks, and keeping them warm with her body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Some few birds, as the ostrich, hide their eggs in
the sand to be hatched by sun heat. One or two
other kinds of birds hide their eggs in earth or
leaves.</p>

<p>I shall tell you of only a few things about the bird’s
body. I wish to tell you just enough about birds
to interest you, so that you will try to learn more
about them.</p>

<p>The first thing for you to notice about the body of the
bird is, that it is built for lightness. The bones
are thin, and most of them are hollow. Your
bones, and the bones of four-legged animals, are
either solid, or hollow and filled in the centre with
marrow. But the bird’s bones are made to give
it the greatest possible size, with the least possible
weight.</p>

<p>Not only are the bird’s bones hollow, but it is able to
send warm air from its lungs through them.
Thus they not only do not weigh the bird down,
but really help to keep it up in the air.</p>

<p>The bird has more bones in its neck than men or
beasts have. The bird’s neck is long, and bends
easily. Its head and neck divide the air before it
as it flies. Even birds which look short-necked
have really more bones in the back of the neck
than you have. They owe the short look to the
feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>The body of the bird is built on the <i>boat plan</i>. It is
an air-boat. Its breast-bone serves as a keel. It
is placed low down, and is large and sharp. In
very strong, flying birds, as the eagle, this keel is
very large. To this are fastened the many strong
muscles which move the wings. The few birds
which do not fly, as the ostrich and penguin, have
the breast-bone flattened or “raft-shape.”</p>

<p>The ribs of the bird form a large, light, boat-shaped
frame. Its tail is made of a number of backbone
pieces, crowded close together. This tail moves
easily, and serves the bird as a rudder, to steer
and steady its way through the air.</p>

<p>If you strip all the meat off a chicken’s wing-bones,
you will see a kind of a rude pattern of a man’s
arm and hand, with a thumb and two fingers.
The length of the wing usually depends on the
length of the upper wing-bone. But in humming-birds
and swifts, the lower part of the wing is the
longer.</p>

<p>In some birds, the wing, when spread out, is much
longer than all the body. The wing folds up,
something like a crab’s claw, or as you would shut
a knife. In birds that are walkers, and not
flyers, the first wing-bone is short. The penguin,
which never flies, has a little short wing, which
looks like a hand, without any arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Now, we come to the bird’s legs. In your leg, the
thigh-bone, the one from the hip to the knee, is
the longest. In birds, it is the shortest. Even in
very long-legged birds, as the stork, the thigh-bone
is short. The length comes in the bone from
the knee to the foot.</p>

<p>Thus, when the bird flies, its large, hollow, air-filled
thigh-bone is drawn up to the body, and the lower
part of the leg is held backward, and does not
hinder the flight.</p>

<p>The foot of most birds has four toes. But some, as the
ostrich, have less. I shall talk to you about feet
in the next lesson.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice about the bird’s head is the
beak. I shall tell you about beaks, also, in the
next lesson. Now, I shall only say, that the beak
is the horny, outer end of the jaw-bone. Birds
never have any teeth. The beak often forms the
larger part of the bird’s head. The head is small
for the body, and nearly flat on top.</p>

<p>When you see a bird with two things like horns on its
head, as some owls have, do not think that they
are either horns or ears. Birds have no horns.
These things are only feather head-dresses. Birds
have ears, but the ear-hole is hidden under the
feathers. Birds have very keen sight, very keen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
power of smell.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They have loud, clear voices.
Many of them have very sweet voices. I suppose
they have as good a sense of taste as we have. I
notice that parrots like sugar and cake, and many
birds like fruit.</p>

<p>What do birds have instead of teeth? They have
inside of the body a gizzard. It is part of the
stomach. It is so made that it can grind up the
food as teeth would. Some birds swallow bits of
shell and gravel, which help the grinding.</p>

<p>The food goes into a bag called a crop. From the crop
it goes to the gizzard, where it is ground. Mother
birds feed their very young birds with food which
has been softened in this way.</p>

<p>When you look at a bird, you will first of all notice the
feathers. They are its clothing, and help it in flying.
Next to the body grows a soft down. There
are patches on the body where only down grows.
These spots, bare of feathers, give room for the
play or motion of the larger feathers. Such spots
do not show, as the over-lapping of the large and
small feathers covers them.</p>

<p>The tail and wing feathers are the largest. The quill
part of the feather is hollow. You cannot move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
the hairs on your head. The bird can move its
feathers, and turns the large ones flat or sideways,
as it changes its flight. The smaller feathers are
called coverts. They are laid on one close over
the other. They are chiefly for clothes, as the
large ones are chiefly for flying.</p>

<p>Many birds have splendid feathers. Have you seen the
great train of a peacock? But the peacock is not
a bird that flies much. His tail would hinder
him in the air. All he can do in flying is to rise
to a roof or the limb of a tree. Some other birds
have one or two long gay tail plumes which do
not hinder their flight.</p>

<p>When the little bird is first hatched it has no feathers.
Have you seen the wee chicks, just out of the
shell? They are dressed in down. What fluffy
balls they are!</p>

<p>Peep into the robin’s nest, and see the nearly naked
birds. They have for clothes only a few long
hairs. Do not touch them. Do not go when the
mother bird is there. But peep in each day, and
watch how the feathers grow. Or, you can watch
feathers grow on your baby canary. They grow
very fast.</p>

<p>When first the robins begin to fly, notice that their
feathers are not quite like those of the old bird.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
The young robin’s breast is spotted, not plain red.
His feathers lie loosely. He looks puffy. Birds
moult or cast their coats. They drop their feathers
in hot weather. This gives them a chance to
change old broken feathers for new ones. They
get warm new coats for winter. They do not drop
all the feathers at once. But some feathers go
and some come, until the moult is over.</p>

<p>Most birds have some little bags of oil in their skin,
on the back part of their bodies. They can press
the oil out of these bags with their bills.
Have you ever watched birds preening, or dressing
themselves? They are spreading this oil over
their feathers to keep them soft and clean.</p>

<p>Birds are very lovely creatures. They have graceful,
elegant shapes, eyes bright like jewels, and very
fine bright colors. They are also very wonderful
in their ways. And many of them are very useful.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> Some naturalists deny that birds have the sense of smell to any

<p class="ph3">BEAKS AND CLAWS.</p>


<p>Let us go out and take a walk together. What is this
on the ground? It is a bird’s foot. You know it
by the four toes, three before and one behind; by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the scale-like, rough skin; by the long, sharp nails
on the toes.</p>

<p>What is this other thing lying here? That! Why, it
is a bird’s bill, or beak. You see that it is made
in two pieces, of a hard, bony substance. Now
from the beak and the bill, can you go on and
build up the bird for me? Can you tell me what
kind of bird it was; where it lived; what it did;
what it ate?</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_182" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_182.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">BEAKS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No,” you say, “of course not.” But let us see. Are
all beaks alike? Think. “No,” you say, “they
are not alike.” The duck’s bill is flat, and soft,
and spoon-shaped. The parrot’s bill is hard, not
wide, but high. The upper part bends over the
under. It is curved like a hooked nose.</p>

<p>The hen has a much smaller beak; it is thick, short,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
hard, pointed. The two parts join evenly. The
swallow has a very short, pointed bill. It can
open its mouth very wide. It is a three-cornered
bill,—like a triangle in shape. But the humming-bird
has a very long, slim bill; almost as slim as
a knitting-needle.</p>

<p>Once I saw a kingfisher. He had a thick, strong bill.
It was nearly as large as his body. I wondered
how he could carry it. In a museum I saw a bird
with a bill as wide as my hand, and longer. It
looked heavy enough to make the bird fall down.</p>

<p>Now I think you have told me a good many things
about beaks. Let us take a little look at them,
and see what kinds of feet go with them. How
does the duck live? He lives mostly in the water.
On land, if he walks, he waddles, but he swims
with grace.</p>

<p>He dives down in the water, thrusts his bill into the
mud, and feels about for things to eat. There,
you see, he needs a wide bill, shaped like a spoon,
or shovel. He does not need a very hard bill, as
mud is soft. But he needs a bill that can feel the
right kind of food, and pick it up, just as your
fingers feel things for which you search in a bag.</p>

<p>Now what kind of feet has a duck? It has large feet,
with three long front toes, and one short hind toe,
rather high up on the foot. What you notice in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the feet is a web, or skin, joining the toes together
quite up to the nail.</p>

<p>Have you watched the duck in the water? Have you
seen him use these webbed feet for paddles? Now
the swimming birds, to which ducks, geese, and
swans belong, all have webbed feet. They all have
the broad, flat, rather soft bill.</p>

<p>Thus, when you find a wide full-webbed foot, you say,
“This bird was built for swimming. It had a
light, wide body, shaped much like a boat. Its
feet were its paddles. Its wings were not very
large. It had very thick feathers, to keep it
warm. They were oily to keep it dry. It fed on
water plants, seeds, grain, and things that it found
in the mud.”</p>

<p>Sometimes you will find the beak of a swimming bird
telling a different story. It will be a very strong
beak, with notches along it. It is a fish-eating
swimmer. Its rough bill is to hold fast to the
slippery fish.</p>

<p>Then, too, you may find webbed feet which have a new
story to tell. You may find a webbed foot, quite
small, with a very long leg. The web goes only
part way to the toe nail. That bird could not
swim. No. He was a wading bird.</p>

<p>His long stilt-like legs held his body above the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
while he watched for his fish food. The webs in
his feet served, not to make him a paddle-foot, but
just to keep him from sinking in the soft sand or
mud. Or you may find the webs changed to broad
flaps on each toe.</p>

<p>Now turn to the hen. Is her beak made for digging in
mud, under water? No. Her short, strong beak
is for picking up grain or insects from the ground.
Now see what feet she has to match this beak.
She has walking feet. Her feet are large and
strong, with separate toes and strong nails. How
does she use her feet? She spends nearly all her
time scratching and digging in the ground. She
scratches up the earth with her toes. She finds
insects, worms, larvæ, and such things, to eat.</p>

<p>Once more look at a beak. Take the swallow’s short,
wide, widely opening beak. Watch the swallow
as he flies. Now up, now down! Now here, now
there! He wheels, he makes a dash! He feeds
upon the wing. He eats insects. See that short,
broad mouth, which opens as wide as his whole
head, and shows his big yellow throat. Is it not
just the thing for catching insects?</p>

<p>The swallow sweeps after the insect, and into that open
throat it goes! What story will this beak tell?</p>

<p>The story of a bird made for flying fast and far. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
story of a bird built to wheel and turn quickly. It
must have large wings, a very light body. As its
head is so wide, it must be flat, or it will be too
large.</p>

<p>This bird does not need to walk. Its food is in the air.
Its legs and feet will be very small. Its toes will
be long, and made for holding or clinging to trees
or roofs. Its feathers must be close set; and its
tail be well shaped for a rudder.</p>

<p>Suppose some one shows you the foot of an ostrich. It
is a huge foot, with two great toes. You will say
at once “that is a walking foot.” It is not to be
carried into the air. These great toes are not for
digging, but for walking or running.</p>

<p>Look at the soles of these toes. They are cushioned or
padded thick. That bird must live where the soil
is soft, and these padded feet will keep him from
sinking. Yes, he lived on the desert sand. He is
the largest bird in the world. He can run faster
than a horse. Such a bird could not be lifted into
the air on wings. He has short, stout wings, which
he flaps as he runs, and as they have large feathers
on them, they catch the air as sails do, and so help
him along.</p>

<p>His bill is like a huge hen’s bill. He eats melons,
grass, and grain.</p>

<p>These are some of the stories told by beaks and feet.</p>

<p class="ph3">TREE, GROUND, AND WATER BIRDS.</p>


<p>In old times they told fables of birds which had no
feet, and lived always on the wing. There are no
such birds. All birds have feet, all rest from flying.
But the motion
of flying is so beautiful
and easy, that it
is no wonder that
birds of strong flight
are much upon the
wing.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp76" id="i_187" style="max-width: 111.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_187.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">AT THE POND.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The eagle and hawk families
are very swift of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
flight, and spend most of their time mounting and
wheeling. They are keen of sight, and from
great heights will see their prey, and swoop down
upon it.</p>

<p>The swallow family seems never tired of flying. They
feed upon the wing. The tiny humming-birds
move their wings so quickly, you cannot see them.
They hover with this motion while they drink
honey from flowers. They are very seldom seen
resting.</p>

<p>Pigeons are among our swiftest birds. Have you
noticed how thirsty pigeons are? That is because
they are very hot blooded. They need much hot
blood to warm up in their lungs the air which they
drive through their hollow bones. Thus they
make a kind of balloon of their bodies. The
pigeon’s body helps to keep it up in the air.</p>

<p>Many of the birds that live much on the wing build
their nests on or in trees. I shall tell you a little
of nests in another lesson. Now we will speak of
one or two tree-living birds.</p>

<p>The butcher bird, or shrike, is about the size of a robin.
It is a pretty bird, gray or brown in color. Its
food is living things, as beetles, bees, mice, and
young birds. It has a very curious habit. It
brings home part of its food, and hangs it on a
thorn near its nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>The butcher bird chooses trees with thorns or sharp
twigs, and makes its nest among them. Then on
the thorns, all about the nest, it hangs insects and
little animals. I saw one of these nests once,
about which hung a young bluebird, a beetle, three
bees, and a big spider.</p>

<p>I have thought it may hang up little dead animals
partly as a trap for big blue-bottle flies. For these
flies cluster about the dead bodies, and the shrike,
keeping guard near his nest, picks them up at his
ease.</p>

<p>A much nicer bird, one which I wish lived in our country,
is the bower bird. This bird makes its nest in
a tree, but fashions a little arbor for itself, among
the grasses. Into its grass palace it brings all the
pretty things it can find. Shells, bright stones,
bits of cloth, glass, bones, flowers, are all brought
to its little play-house. Would you not love a
bird which had such pretty ways?</p>

<p>Of all the birds in our own land, none is more splendid
than the cardinal bird of the South. He has a
crimson beak and plumes. His song is very sweet.
He is a brave bird, and very kind and polite to
his mate. It is very cruel to kill such a creature
for its feathers.</p>

<p>In the North, we have the blue jay, nearly as fine a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
bird as the cardinal. He has a jet-black collar, a
bright coat of shaded blue, and a white neck-tie.
Indeed, he is a fine, gay, saucy, cheerful bird. But
he has a very naughty way of breaking up the
nests of other birds, and stealing their eggs.</p>

<p>The jay likes to have his home near the water, and
when you go near it, he comes out and scolds
loudly.</p>

<p>But now we will turn from birds which make their
homes in trees, and look a little at birds that live
on the ground. You will at once think of the
barn-yard fowls, and their many cousins.</p>

<p>Have you seen a barn-yard full of these birds? It is a
fine sight. There are the spotted guinea fowls
with their fretful cry, and the great peacocks
spreading their splendid trains. There are the
black, white, yellow, spotted, red, and green-breasted
cocks and hens, and there are pheasants
which seem to be dressed in rainbows.</p>

<p>Among these fowls the turkey struts, spreading his tail
like a wheel, and scraping the tips of his wings on
the ground, as he walks high on his toes. Far
out in the Western woods, you may see the wild
turkey, which is nearly as fine a bird as a pheasant
or a peacock.</p>

<p>Turkey hens are very good mothers. They seem very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
fond of their little ones, and are always on the
watch to guard them. By nature they are shy
birds, and like to run away, and hide their nests.
One will go off and hide a nest, and seem very
proud to come back with a train of fifteen or more
little ones.</p>

<p>Grouse, partridges, and quails, are ground-living birds,
related to our common fowls. So are the pretty
prairie-hens of the West. The quail is a dear
little bird. Sometimes in the winter, when the
snow is deep, and it cannot find food, it will come
to the barn-yard or the door-step, and feed with
the fowls. Once, in the woods, I came softly to
an opening, and there were about twenty quails
feeding on a bed of squaw-berries. They ran
about picking up berries and making happy little
sounds, like a band of children enjoying a holiday.</p>

<p>One day I was going through a pine-wood path, when
a mother quail and ten little ones ran across the
roadway. She hid in the brush, and began to call,
“Come! Come! Come!” and from the other side
of the path, little squeaks replied, “Yes! Yes!
Yes!”</p>

<p>Soon three more brown, fluffy balls ran across the road.
Then out ran the little brown mother in great distress.
Her neck feathers stood out in a collar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
“Come! come! come!” she called. “Wee! wee!
wee!” said a little faint voice, and tumbling along
the foot path, went one more small bird. “Now
she has them all,” I thought.</p>

<p>But still, out of the brush, the anxious mother cried,
“Come! come!” and at last, dropping into ruts,
rolling in the dust, too new and weak even to say,
“Wee,” hardly able to keep on his legs, went the
tiniest little bird! He followed his mother’s voice,
and slipped in among the brush and pine needles.</p>

<p>When the little brown mother had all her brood, she
made a sweet, low, glad note in her hiding place.
“O Mrs. Quail!” I cried; “can you count? Can
you count fifteen?” She never told me whether she
could or not. But she had counted fifteen that
time, that was sure.</p>

<p>Now, let us take a peep at the birds which live mostly
on the water; you will think first of the great,
solemn white swans. Then of the snowy geese
and of the parti-colored ducks. What splendid
colors ducks have!</p>

<p>If you live by the sea, you will often watch the gulls
and gannets with their wide white wings. All
these birds build their nests in reeds and grass
along the bank, or in ledges of rock in a cliff.</p>

<p>One day I was sitting behind some rocks on a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
island. All at once I heard a hearty laugh. I
rose up softly, and looked over the rocks. There
on the water sat, all alone, a water-fowl. I hid
my head and gave a loud “ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>Then the bird threw back his head, and gave a laugh
with all its might. It made me think of what my
grandfather used to say to the boys, if they were
too loud in their mirth for his taste. “Do not
laugh like a loon,” he would say.</p>

<p>Is it news to you that a bird can laugh? The water-fowl
and I laughed at each other for a long time.
Then I rose and stood in plain sight. Down he
went under the water, and I saw him no more. I
wish you would read a lovely poem written by the
poet Bryant, about “The Water-fowl.”</p>

<p>Once I was out on the sea in a boat. We saw lying on
the water the tail of a fish. We rowed near.
Well! Here was a sight! A large duck, called
an alwife,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> had tried to swallow a fish. But the
fish was too big for her throat. Having got part
of it in, she could get the fish neither in nor out.
So she and the fish had both choked to death, and
were floating around in the water.</p>

<p>A very famous man once said, that he thought a gull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
must be the most happy of birds. It can swim,
fly, walk, almost equally well. It is at home on
earth, water, or air.</p>

<p>I have seen a bird called “The Diver.” It goes down
under water for its food. It uses its wings under
water to swim with, and will stay there a long
time. Most ducks will dive, and come up a long
way from where they went down.</p>

<p>The water birds all have close, thick plumage. Most
of the down which we use, comes from the water
birds of the far North. The down not only keeps
them warm, but keeps air in its meshes, and helps
them to float. It is like a cork jacket for them.</p>

<p>Water birds live chiefly on fish, crabs, and little water
animals. But many of them eat seeds and berries
of plants growing along the coast. They will
readily pick up any kind of food thrown upon the
water. Gulls follow ships for days to get the
scraps thrown overboard by the sailors.</p>

<p>In the spring and
summer, you go to
field and garden,
and you hear and
see many birds.
As you walk about
the woods, you
may see a dozen
kinds of birds in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
a few minutes. There will go a yellow-bird,
looking like a canary. There, all splendid in
black and gold, an oriole is busy building his
curious nest. There flies from the swamp a red-wing
blackbird. A big woodpecker drums on
the nearest tree. A bluebird with a russet breast
sits singing on the top rail of a fence. Sparrows,
swallows, crows, are everywhere.</p>

<p>Out of the grass whirrs up a lark with his brown and
yellow coat, and black velvet collar. The thrush
sings in a bush. The catbird, in the shade, cheers
his mate with a rich, mellow note, and then darts
out into the sunshine in his glossy drab dress.</p>

<p>But in late autumn, or in winter, you walk abroad,
and where are all the birds? A crow may sit,
scolding, on a dead limb. A social robin may flit
down to your door. The velvet sparrows may be
balls of noise and feathers. But where are the
other birds? Are they all dead?</p>

<p>Oh, no! They have flown off to sunny lands, where
they will have mild weather, and food in plenty,
and green trees. The birds <i>migrate</i>. What is it
to migrate? It is to go from one place to another
a long way off. They migrate as the season
changes.</p>

<p>Let us take that pretty bird, the bobolink, as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
example of a bird on his travels. In the winter
months he is feasting and singing in the warm
West India Islands. There he finds grubs, insects,
and seeds in plenty. He grows so fat, that they
call him the butter-bird.</p>

<p>About the first of April, he finds Jamaica too hot for
him, and flies over to Georgia, or South Carolina.
He settles in the rice-fields, and eats so much
rice that he is a great trouble to the planters.
They call him the rice-bird. But they are soon
rid of him. About the middle of May, the rice-bird,
with hundreds of his relations, goes up to
Virginia and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>At this time, he eats May-flies, caterpillars, and various
insects. But his taste for seeds continues, and he
devours the young wheat and barley at a great
rate. The farmers name him the reed-bird. Many
reed-birds are shot, and sent to market.</p>

<p>In spite of the guns, the bobolink seems now in the
gayest hour of his life. He sings with all his
might, and his black and white coat, with its
touches of yellow, is at its best.</p>

<p>But again he starts northward. He goes up to New
York, and New England, and appears in the
orchards and wheat-fields, at the end of May, or
the first of June. There he is called, from his
song, the bobolink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. and Mrs. Bobolink must now set themselves
to the serious business of making a nest, and rearing
a family. They choose a good nest place, and
begin to build in a great hurry. Mrs. Bobolink
is not so gayly dressed as her mate. She is brown,
with a little dull yellow in her plumage.</p>

<p>Mr. Bobolink ends his wildest songs when the little
birds come from the shells. Their mouths are
always wide open, crying for food. Mr. Bobolink
is very busy feeding his children. He flies
back and forth all day long, bringing insects to his
nursery. The gay concerts are ended.</p>

<p>At this time, too, Mr. Bobolink changes his clothes.
He puts on a working suit, with more brown in it.
His gay plumes do not come back until the next
spring.</p>

<p>After the little ones learn to fly, in August, if it is hot,
the whole family may go to Canada, for a trip.
But as soon as the cool September mornings come,
all the bobolinks think of the South. They
gather in great companies, and turn their heads
toward the West Indies.</p>

<p>Now and then, they may rest for a few hours, or a
warm day or so, but they fly pretty steadily southward.
When cold weather has come, we see no
more bobolinks. They are all busy eating and
singing in the sunny tropic lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>I wish you would all read, and perhaps learn to recite
a charming poem called “Robert o’ Lincoln.” It
was written, by the great poet Bryant, about this
little bird of many names, and many homes.</p>

<p>Now from the story of the bobolink, you see the manner
of this migration of birds. You see <i>why</i> birds
migrate. It is to keep where they find the food
and the weather which they prefer. Its <i>cause</i> is
the change of the season. As the season changes
the food changes.</p>

<p>Some birds move away because it is growing too hot
where they are, and they like cooler places. Again,
there are birds which stay near us in the winter,
and fly North in the summer, almost to the land of
constant snow.</p>

<p>Those birds which breed in the cold polar regions often
find a winter home in the Northern States. But
some birds which breed in the coldest climates fly
to hot countries for their winter of rest and play.</p>

<p>When birds come in the spring, and leave in the fall,
they rear their young where they make their summer
home. We call them our summer birds.</p>

<p>Our winter birds are those which come to us in the
cold weather, do not build nests near us, but fly
away when the season grows warm. While they
stay near us, they take shelter at night in shrubs
or evergreen trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>What we call birds of passage are birds that stop with
us for only a few days, as they are flying long distances,
half round the world, perhaps.</p>

<p>Then there are birds, as the robin, sparrow, thrush,
which may stay all the year round near one place.
In the warm weather they build nests, and rear
their young. In cold weather, such birds are often
driven near houses and barns to get food.</p>

<p>Crows may stay all winter in one place if food is plenty.
If they cannot find enough to eat, they gather in
great numbers, and fly to places where they will
get more food.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I read that swallows, cuckoos,
corn-crakes, and other birds, would lie torpid all
winter. The book I read told me that the birds
would cluster in great masses, silent, nearly frozen,
eating nothing, and in the spring would wake up
fresh and gay. That is not at all true. They do
not lie torpid. They fly away.</p>

<p>Birds gather in great numbers, with much noise and
flurry, to get ready for a trip. Crows, storks,
cranes, swallows, and others, fly in great flocks.
By the sea-side you may hear a far-off cry and a
rush of wings, and looking up, you may see a flock
of wild geese, or ducks, on their journey, flying far
out over the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>When a vast flock moves in this way, they seem to
have some few wise old birds for guides, in advance,
and some for guards on each side of the
band. Geese fly in a <b>V</b>-shaped line, for hours at a
time. When they need to stop for food, they
break the <b>V</b> line and fly in disorder. They seem
to search the ground for a feeding place. A cornfield
suits them best, and they settle for a feast.
If they cannot find a cornfield they will try a
swamp.</p>

<p>Hawks travel over half the world. The hawk, which
summers on the Scotch hills, may go to Egypt for
winter, and perch on the pyramids. The stork,
which the little Dutch children in Holland feed
and love, may go to Africa for Christmas. The
birds which you feed in July will be singing in
Hayti or Brazil in January.</p>

<p>What is very strange is, that birds will, year after year,
come back to the very place and nest that they left.
The oriole, catbird, bluebird, jay, titmouse, and
others, will each summer return to the same vine
or tree, to build a new nest or repair the old one.</p>

<p>They come singing back, and we are glad to see them.
But from their songs we get no news of the fair
tropic lands where they have been happy amid
rich fruits and flowers.</p>

<p class="ph3">NEST BUILDING.</p>

<p>I think nothing
about
birds is
more interesting
than their
way of building their
nests. In this lesson
we will look at a few
curious nest-builders.</p>

<p>First, let me tell you that
that largest of birds,
the ostrich, builds no
nest. She puts her
eggs in the sand. The
sun-heat is all they
need during the day,
and the father-bird
cares for them at night.
A few birds lay their eggs in heaps of dead leaves,
and let the leaves keep them warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The cuckoo,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and the cow-bird<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> lay their eggs in the
nest of some other bird. They choose a bird
smaller than themselves, and put one egg in its
nest. Then they go to another nest, and so on,
until their eggs are laid.</p>

<p>A few birds lay their eggs right on the earth, or sand,
and make no nest at all. But they sit on the
eggs, and brood them. Most birds make nice,
careful nests. They seem to take pride in building
good homes.</p>

<p>A lady who has carefully studied the ways of birds,
says that all birds of a kind do not build equally
good nests. For instance, some robins build very
strong, neat nests. Others build loose, untidy
nests, which will hardly hold the eggs.</p>

<p>This same lady says that birds, by practice, improve
in nest building. As a rule, she thinks the old
birds, that have built for several years, make
better nests than robins building for their first
brood. She says she watched a robin, which had
a home in her garden. That robin improved in
nest building, and built better and better each
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps no bird builds a more firm, neat, and elegant
nest, than that smallest of all,—the humming-bird.
This bird does not need a large nest, she is so tiny,
and her eggs, usually only two, are like small
beans. The nest is made in the shape of a cup.
It is built of soft moss, or the downy seeds of
plants. These are pressed and moulded until they
are almost like felt.</p>

<p>The nest is made quite thick. All over the outside,
the bird fastens bits of moss, or lichens. These
are stuck on with a kind of glue, from the bird’s
mouth. This is done, not so much for beauty, as
to conceal the nest. When thus pasted over with
moss, it looks like a knot or bit of tree branch.</p>

<p>This tiny bird is very shy, and wishes to hide its nest.
It is so cunningly built, that even when close by
it you are little likely to see it.</p>

<p>The bird does not fly straight to, or from, this nest.
That might lead enemies there. Instead, it rises
high, straight up into the air, and when up out of
sight, takes its direction as it chooses. When it
comes back, it pursues a similar plan. From far
up in the air, above the nest, it drops straight
down, like a little fiery star, into its home.</p>

<p>The goldfinch is another bird which glues mosses on
the outside of its nest to hide it. While this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
done rather for use than beauty, I think most
birds like to have a pretty home. I have seen
birds weave bits of colored wool, or silk, in and
out the nest, plainly for the sake of the color, and
not for strength.</p>

<p>All the finch family line their nest with down or feathers.
The wood-wren, on the contrary, lines its
nest always with hair, and never with feathers.
She goes far and wide to find soft hairs for this
use.</p>

<p>I think an oriole’s nest is one of the most beautiful of
bird-homes. The mother-oriole makes the nest,
and her mate brings her wool, fine root-fibres, hairs
and threads, which she uses. If he brings her a
bit which she does not like, she throws it away,
and seems to think him a bird of very little sense.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Oriole is not suited with her work, as it goes
on, she tears it down, and goes to work again.
She wants it just right.</p>

<p>The nest is in the shape of a long pocket, and is sewed
firmly to some twigs on the end of a branch. It
is very curious to see the stitches which are taken
in and out, with string, or long horse-hairs. The
nest is tied firmly to the tree, and is woven very
firmly together. It is lined with downy seeds.
The entrance is small and near the top, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
nest is larger at the bottom, where the young
birds will lie.</p>

<p>The tailor-bird sews even better than the oriole. She
takes a large leaf, bends the edges against those
of a leaf near, and carefully sews them together,
with bits of fibre for thread, while her bill is the
needle. When this leaf-purse is made, the cunning
little mother fills it half full of cotton-like down,
from plants, and her home is made. Sometimes
she chooses a large leaf, and sews its edges together.</p>

<p>The object of these nests is to have them hung far out,
where snakes cannot get at the eggs or young.
For you must know that snakes are cruel enemies
of birds.</p>

<p>The house-sparrow likes to build her nest under overhanging
eaves. If she builds where she has not a
roof of that kind, she makes a roof for herself, of
straw.</p>

<p>Many birds, as the woodpecker, titmouse, and others,
find a hole in a tree, and put in a soft lining.
This makes a very nice, safe home.</p>

<p>The golden-crested wren makes a most lovely nest of
mosses, woven firmly together with spiders’ webs
and cobwebs. It is very delicate and pretty.</p>

<p>Just the opposite of this is a magpie’s nest. That is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
a large platform of coarse twigs, and over it a
roof, quite as large, of twigs, while all around it
the magpie sets up a thorn fence. You would
hardly think a bird could build such a house.</p>

<p>Once I found the nest of the song thrush. It was
large, and made of grass, straw, and such things,
all firmly plastered with mud. It was nearly as
smooth inside as a china bowl. I wondered that
this little bird could build such a large, heavy nest.</p>

<p>Many birds which live near the water build their nests
among the tall reeds. They will bind three or
four reeds together, with the nest hung between
them.</p>

<p>No doubt you have often found the neat little round
nest of the bluebirds, or yellow-birds, nicely woven
of hairs, and made smooth and soft inside. Sometimes
their soft, smooth nests are woven of fine,
soft fibres. It is wonderful how fine and clean
they are, after the little busy bird has made them
ready for her home.</p>

<p>Many birds build in clefts of rocks, or under large overhanging
stones by the water-side. Their chief
thought seems to be, to have the nest safely hidden.
Other birds build right on the ground.
Have you never found a lark’s nest, low among
daisies, grass and buttercups?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Last summer I found two nests of the meadow pipit, or
peewee. They were built of dry grass in a hollow,
shaded by some bramble-berry bushes and big dandelions.
I had one of these nests drawn for the
cover of this Reader. It was a very pretty bower,
and the little birds grew up safely.</p>

<p>Most birds build each one alone, but in Africa the
weaver-bird lives in colonies. The nests are built
like very large wasps’ nests. Sometimes one or
two hundred birds will build in one place. They
make a roof for the nest.</p>

<p>I began by telling you of very little nests. I will end
by telling you of a very big nest. I saw the nest
of a fishing eagle, in a great pine-tree. The nest
was built of large sticks. It was nearly as large
as a half barrel. The tree was dead. A tree
always dies when an eagle builds in it. This nest
was more like a great rough platform than a nest.
It had a wall of sticks about it to keep the little
eaglets from falling out before their feathers grew.</p>

<p>You have now seen the
bird building a nest,
and you have seen the
finished nest. Let us
take a little look at
the bird at home. Let
us have a peep at the
family life of birds.</p>

<p>The mother-bird lays two,
four, six, or more eggs
in her nest. Each kind
of bird has its own
kind of eggs. The
wood-pigeon has a pure
white egg; the blackbird’s
egg is a bluish
green, with russet
spots; the cuckoo’s egg
is of a yellowish tint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
with red and brown marks; the kingfisher’s egg
is yellow with orange spots; the robin’s egg is a
lovely greenish blue. Some eggs have purple
spots, some are brown with red spots.</p>

<p>Each bird knows its own eggs. Sometimes a lazy cow-bird
puts her eggs in the nest of a wren or bluebird,
while that bird is away looking for food.
When the bird comes home, she knows at once
the strange egg in her nest. She scolds and cries.
But, in the end, she takes care of it.</p>

<p>When eggs are put into a nest in this way, it is the
strange egg which thrives. The cow-bird hatches
before the eggs among which it lies. Then the
mother-bird at once begins to feed her adopted
child, and her own eggs are left and do not hatch.</p>

<p>The young cuckoo is so big and strong that it pushes
its foster brothers and sisters out of the nest, and
lives there alone. The good mother-bird, perhaps
only a little sparrow, tires herself out bringing
insects for the wide-open beak of her big, greedy
child.</p>

<p>The mother-bird is very patient all the long days, or
weeks, while she must sit brooding her eggs. If
you go near her, she may fly off, or she may
cower close over her eggs, and look at you in a
very timid way. I am sure you will hurry past,
and not terrify the dear little thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>When the mother-bird must go away, to stretch her
wings in flight, or to get food, the father-bird takes
her place. While she is on the nest, he often
brings her something good to eat. He sits on
some branch near and sings to her. He watches
to see if any snake or squirrel, or other enemy, is
coming near. Then he often flies down, and scolds,
or pecks at the foe to drive it off.</p>

<p>I am sorry to tell you that the handsome blue jay is
very cruel to other birds. He often tears up their
nests, breaks their eggs, or kills their little ones,
for the mere sake of doing it. The eggs of smaller
birds, he carries to his own nestlings for food. I
knew a lady who saw a jay bring three small eggs
to his nest. He carried them in his bill.</p>

<p>One summer, a pair of woodpeckers built in a tall flag-pole
near my house. They had cut out a nice
round hole in the pole, and dug a deep place for a
nest. Several times each day the father-bird took
his turn on the nest, while the mother-bird went
off to a swamp to get food.</p>

<p>It was curious to watch the nest-cleaning each night.
The birds took up refuse from the nest in their
claws, and flew off some distance before they
dropped it.</p>

<p>When the little birds came from the shell, the old ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
were very busy, going and coming several times
each hour, with food.</p>

<p>It was funny to see them at night-fall. The father-bird
took his place, clinging high up on the pole,
like a watchman on a tower, to take a final look,
and see if all was right. The mother-bird, at the
same time, put her handsome head out of the hole,
and stretched her neck, as if to take a look from
her window before she went to bed.</p>

<p>When the birds were fledged, there was a grand time
teaching them to fly. They were taken to a roof
near by, where they sprawled about. Then they
would be coaxed to make a little flight. The
parents flew low and slowly before them. Great
was the joy, if one of the little things flew a few
yards. The old birds seemed to think that they
had never before seen quite such nice flying!
Then the father-bird stood proudly before them,
to give them a lesson in drumming, that is, in
pecking at wood, to break it up, to find grubs or
insects hidden in it. He seemed to say, “Look at
me!” Then he braced his feet and tail,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> held his
head on one side, and gave a number of swift,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
strong blows on my porch roof. He would drum,
and then look at the little ones to imitate him.</p>

<p>Then they flew over the way, and the father seemed to
say, “Now for another lesson in drumming!” At
it he went. But that house had a <i>tin roof</i>. He
could not make the splinters fly!</p>

<p>He tried again. It was of no use. Then he looked
much surprised. He eyed the roof, and tried once
more. The little birds looked on.</p>

<p>But the father-bird failed again. Instead of a long,
deep roll of sound, there was only a sharp rattle;
no chips, no grubs! He seemed much ashamed.
His wings and his tail drooped. Away he flew to
the pole, and sat there very sad. He seemed to be
thinking how much better houses grew when he
was young!</p>

<p>The hole of these birds, in the pole, was tinned over
after they left. They returned next year, and cut
a hole lower down. That was covered with tin in
the fall. Next spring, they came back, and cut a
hole higher up. They did this for five years.</p>

<p>Finally the pole had to be taken down as dangerous,
it was so cut up.</p>

<p>Woodpeckers are not the only good bird parents. You
can see how kind and careful mother-birds are, if
you watch the hens in the farm-yard. Do you see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
them lead their little chicks out? They scratch
the earth, and call the chicks to come and pick up
food. When a hawk appears, the hen cries out,
and spreads her wings wide, to shelter her chicks.</p>

<p>When it rains, or when the little ones are tired, or at
night, the hen calls them to rest under her wide,
warm wings.</p>

<p>If you watch a pair of robins raising a brood, you will
wonder to see how many times in an hour they go
and come, bringing food. When the little ones are
fledged, notice how they are taught to fly. You
may, also, see the father bird giving his little ones
a lesson in singing.</p>

<p>When one of the young birds is weaker than the rest,
one of the parents will leave the others, and give all
the time to teaching and helping that weak one.</p>

<p>A bluebird in my garden, lost, by one trouble and
another, all her brood but one. That one the
parent birds were teaching to fly. It rested on
the gravel walk, while the old birds sat on the
fence, and called it.</p>

<p>A boy of three years, seeing the young bird, went up
close to look at it. The father bluebird flew close
over the child’s head scolding. As the child got
near the young bird, the old bird flew upon the
child’s head and pulled his hair with its beak!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>The little boy ran screaming back to me. The young
bluebird lifted his wings, and flew with his parents
into a bush. Was not the father bluebird brave?
The child, though only three years old, was many
times bigger than the bird.</p>

<p>I told you how the birds cleaned their nests. Birds
are neat creatures. You notice that their feathers
are bright and clean. Have you seen how much
they prune or dress them?</p>

<p>Birds are very fond of a bath. If you set a basin or
pan of clean, fresh water, on the grass, among
shrubs or trees, you will see many birds going to
it to take a bath. They splash the water about
in fine style. When the young birds are fledged,
they will be brought to your basin to have a wash.</p>

<p>When birds roll or whirl in dust or sand, it is not
that they like dirt; they are having a sand bath.
The sand flirted in and out among their plumage
takes out grease and little insects and dirt. Then
they shake off all the sand.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BIRDS OF SONG.</p>


<p>The woods and the fields would be very dull and silent
without the song of the birds. Even the shrill
chirp of the sparrow is a pleasant sound to hear.
It gives us an idea of happy life.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_216" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_216.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A JOYFUL SONG.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We will now talk a little about our best song birds.
Let us take the catbird first, as that is common in
all parts of the country. It is a pretty drab and
black bird, about nine inches long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Tom said to me, “A catbird cannot sing; it gets its
name because it squalls like a cat.” True, Tom,
the bird has that harsh note for you, and to
frighten off snakes and other enemies. But you
listen to him when he sits in the shade, and sings
to himself, or makes his best song for Mrs. Catbird.</p>

<p>Ah, there is a song for you! Mellow and full, and
rich as the tones of a mocking-bird! Now he
trills, now he whistles, now he imitates the songs
of all the sweetest singers of the wood. He can
almost outdo the mocking-bird. He sits in his
shady covert, and seems to be laughing at all the
other singers, as he borrows their music.</p>

<p>First, he breaks out into the oriole’s song; then he
calls like a jay; next he chatters like a sparrow;
then he whistles like a thrush; then he gives
you a little warble from the bluebird’s music-book.
In every song he gives exactly the notes he copies.</p>

<p>A pair of catbirds built in a honeysuckle by my window.
I found they were very loving birds. At a
cry of pain from Mrs. Catbird or the little ones,
the father-bird would come flying back, almost in
fits with distress.</p>

<p>He would fly round and round to seek the cause of
their trouble. If he found any enemy, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
could not drive away, he called so loudly and
sadly that all the birds near came in haste to help
him.</p>

<p>The catbird is one of the bravest of the feathered race.
He will fight and drive off a snake. I have seen
him defend his home against a jay, a crow, or a
squirrel.</p>

<p>A near relative of the catbird is the blackbird. This
is a gay and happy creature. All the warm
weather it pipes sweetly, as it flies here and
there. The red-wing, or colonel blackbird, lives
in swamps. The green-breasted blackbird likes a
drier home.</p>

<p>Blackbirds are social in their habits. You seldom see
one or two alone. If you see one near your home,
you will soon see or hear more. They build their
nests early in the spring. Young blackbirds are
among the first birds fledged in a season.</p>

<p>The nest is large, and often lined with mud. When
the mud dries, the nest is like a rude cup. Then
a soft lining is put in for a bed. In this nest are
laid five eggs of a blue-gray color, dashed with
red or brown.</p>

<p>The blackbird is very brave, and will drive a cat or
a snake from his home. I have seen him chase a
squirrel from his tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Pleasant as is the blackbird’s note, he cannot rival the
thrush. Among all our birds of song, I think the
thrush is best known and best loved. This is a
small bird, of dusky brown and white, the under
part of its body being yellowish white, with black
spots. These birds are fond of woody places, and
live alone or in pairs. During the middle of the
day they are silent.</p>

<p>If you wish to hear the thrush at his best, listen to
him in the early morning, or about sundown,
when he takes his place on the top twig of the
tallest tree he can find. He begins with a clear,
sweet sound, like a German flute. Next he trills
some notes like the tinkle of a chime of silver
bells. Then he pours out a full, rich song, and
repeats it several times.</p>

<p>Soon you will hear some other thrush, from another
tall tree, answer him. They seem to try which
can sing the best. They keep up the concert until
the stars come out, and the fireflies flit among the
grasses.</p>

<p>The food of the thrush is insects and berries. While
he chooses a high place to sing from, he builds
low. He finds a laurel or alder bush which is
hung with some kind of wild vine, as the Virginia
creeper. There he piles up a quantity of withered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
beech-leaves. On these he makes a nest of grass,
plastered with mud. It is lined with fine root-fibres.
In this nest are laid four or five light-blue
eggs, without spots or marks.</p>

<p>Often, if you follow the windings of a shaded brook,
you may see the thrush playing along above the
waters.</p>

<p>When the thrush migrates, he travels by day, and rests
at night. When he alights to sleep, he erects his
tail-feathers, and ruffles up the feathers on his
head. Then he gives a few low calls, hops along
the branches, and bends his head down to peep
below, and see if all is safe for the night. In
fact, from first to last, the song-thrush is a dear
and well-behaved little bird.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXV">LESSON XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE OTHER PARTNER.</p>


<p>You know I told you that the flowers had gone into
business, and taken the birds and insects for their
partners. Now these partners are not good friends
to each other. In fact, the bird partner is given
to eating up the insect partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>We will now look at some birds that prefer insects
to any other food. But these, like all birds, will
change their diet and eat almost anything if very
hungry.</p>

<p>Our first bird shall be the “nuthatch.” It has been
given this name because people think it can crack
nuts. No doubt it can crack beech and hazel
nuts, and chestnuts. Its object is not to get the
meat of the nut, but the grubs that lie in it.</p>

<p>The nuthatch is of a light bluish-gray color, with
some white and black in its feathers. It is not
much larger than a thrush.</p>

<p>Early in April, the nuthatch finds a hole in a tree, or
in a fence rail or an old roof. There he makes a
nest by piling up dead leaves and any soft wool
or hairs he can find.</p>

<p>In this nest are laid five white eggs, with brown spots
on one end. While the mother bird sits on these
eggs, the mate spends all his time near her. If
any danger comes, he flies to the nest. He
hunts for nice fat grubs and worms, and takes
them to the sitting bird to eat.</p>

<p>He searches for insects and larvæ, and little can
escape his big bright eyes. When he takes something
to his mate, he gives a soft, low, glad chirp.
He never passes the door of the nest-hole without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
putting in his head, to make a few cheerful
remarks. He seems to be telling the news.</p>

<p>When the mother-bird flies out, to have a chance to
find food for herself, her mate keeps calling her,
as if to say, “Are you quite safe?” “Are you
there?” And she replies with a little note of joy.</p>

<p>The nuthatch finds most of his food under the bark
of trees. He flies round and round the tree and
strips off pieces of bark. Hidden there, he finds
worms, spiders, caterpillars, eggs and larvæ of
insects. He seems very curious, and pries into
every crack and hole.</p>

<p>The nuthatch seldom migrates. If food is scarce, he
will fly to the barns, and even pick up seeds with
the fowls. But he does not like that food. He
prefers insects.</p>

<p>Another bird that feeds chiefly on insects, is, in many respects,
the loveliest and dearest of birds. Can you
not guess that I mean the bluebird? This bird,
with its blue back and wings, and ruddy breast
is the first to tell us of the return of spring.</p>

<p>On warm days in February, or early March, we see
him flitting above the last melting wreaths of snow,
or sitting on the top rail of the fence. If a few
cold snowy days come, he vanishes. But back he
flies with his mate, and they skim low over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
ground to pick up the first beetles, worms, and
spiders that venture out.</p>

<p>For a few days the two are very busy eating insects. If
Mr. Bluebird finds a very nice, fat bug, he does not
keep it for himself, but flies with it to his mate.
He gives a glad cry, spreads his wings wide, and
drops it into her mouth.</p>

<p>But soon the pair set about cleaning and rebuilding
last year’s nest. If there is a box on a tree in
your garden or orchard, or a hole in a branch,
they will build there year after year.</p>

<p>While the bluebirds are busy setting their house in
order, Mrs. House-Wren gets back from her winter
trip. She peeps in, and seems much vexed that
such a nice house was let before she arrived. As
soon as the bluebirds go off, for some more grass,
or hairs, Mrs. Wren steps in, and pulls a few twigs
out of the new nest. She does this to show her
feelings. But she hurries away, before the blue
owners return.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bluebird puts five or six pale blue eggs in her
nest. She raises two, or even three, broods in a
summer. While she is sitting on the second eggs,
the father bird watches over the young of the first
brood. He feeds them, and takes great care of
them, and lets them perch by him at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Now and then, in the autumn, you will see a pair of
old bluebirds with ten or twelve young ones, of
their various broods. Then they may be feeding
on gum-tree or smilax berries. But spiders and
beetles are their chosen food.</p>

<p>The note of the bluebird is a soft, sweet warble. He
loves sunshine and springtime. In the fall his
note becomes sad and low, as if he mourns because
winter is coming.</p>

<p>When the cold winds, and frosts, and bare trees, make
the country desolate, the bluebird migrates. He
goes to the Southern States, the West Indies, and
Mexico. We are all glad to welcome him back.
He is the prophet of fine weather. The farmers
like him because he eats so many harmful insects.</p>

<p>Of all the insect-eating birds, none is more famous
than the flycatcher, or kingbird. In some places
he is called the field-martin, and the tyrant. The
name flycatcher comes from his food. He catches
living, full-grown insects, such as flies, gnats,
wasps, and some bees. I am sorry that he is
accused of picking up bees.</p>

<p>The name king, or tyrant, bird comes to this brisk
little fellow from his manners. He is very strong,
very swift on the wing, and very bold. He is
fond of his brood and mate, and bold in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
defence. He watches to drive off birds which
might harm them.</p>

<p>The big blue jay dares not rob a kingbird’s nest. The
kingbird will chase a jay, a crow, even an eagle,
or a hawk. His bill is sharp and strong, and as
he flies under or over his enemy, he darts at him,
and drives his bill into him with a peck.</p>

<p>He is so fierce only when he has a young brood to
defend. At other times he is quiet enough. When
his young brood is in the nest, he feels so proud
that he seems to think himself the lord of all
birds.</p>

<p>The purple martin can fly faster than the kingbird
and likes to tease him. It is also very funny to
see a big woodpecker and a kingbird having a
conflict on a fence rail. The woodpecker whirls
round and round like a boy turning springs over
a bar. The kingbird flies from side to side and
tries to get a peck at him but cannot.</p>

<p>The kingbird is not a singer. He is a silent, dark
bird. His plumes are brown, black, and white.
On his head he has a crest, or crown of raised
feathers. He seems very particular about his food.
It is not every insect that he will eat.</p>

<p>Many farmers, who have watched him carefully, say
that he does not pick up worker-bees, but takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
only the drones. He also eats many gad-flies that
trouble and bite the horses. He devours hundreds
of insects and worms which eat fruit, cucumbers,
and pumpkins.</p>

<p>In fact, even if the kingbird does eat a few bees, he
more than pays for that damage by the good
he does in destroying harmful insects. When a
farmer shoots a kingbird he shoots one of his
best friends. Besides all this, as we are not quite
sure that the kingbird does eat worker-bees, I
think we should give him the benefit of the doubt
and let him live.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXVI">LESSON XXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A BRIGADE OF BIRDS.</p>


<p>In some of the lessons in these Nature Readers, you
have been told of crabs that are street-cleaners
of the sea. You have also been told of insects
that are cleaners of the air. I shall now tell
you of some birds that are cleaners of fields and
woods.</p>

<p>This lesson will be about a brigade of birds that do
street-cleaning work. I shall head the list with
the crow. You have seen that big, black bird<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
standing all alone on a dead tree, looking the
country over. You have seen him following the
farmer’s rake and plough in the spring.</p>

<p>You have seen hundreds of crows come together in the
fall, to discuss their migration. You know their
loud, harsh note. You have seen them in their
sleek, black coats, stepping over the snow in winter
time. You know in cold weather they become
very tame, and draw near the houses for food.</p>

<p>One day I heard a loud cawing of crows, and looking
out saw about twenty of them flying in a long,
low line over some bushes, in a field. Every now
and then they stooped to the earth. I watched.
They were chasing a cat. The cat hid in the
bushes. He was trying to escape from the crows.</p>

<p>They flew over the bushes and scolded. Then, as he
ran from one shelter to the next, they stooped
and pecked him. They chased the poor cat all
across a big field. I think he was very glad when
he got under a barn. I suppose the crows saw
that he was watching them, and so they drove
him away.</p>

<p>When a number of crows are in a field, they keep one
crow on a high place, to warn them if danger
is near. They seem to be very wise birds. They
know a man with a gun, as far as they can see
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Crows do some harm by pulling up and eating the
planted corn and sown grain. But they are of
use, as they eat many worms and insects which
destroy crops. You often see crows following a
farmer as he ploughs. They are after the grubs
and worms in the new furrow.</p>

<p>Crows eat lizards, mice, toads, and moles. They also
feed on any dead and decaying flesh which they
can find. A company of crows will pluck off all
the flesh from a decaying animal, and leave the
bones white and clean.</p>

<p>The crow is about as large as a large pigeon. It is
jet black, and not handsome. Like all flesh-eating
birds it has a large strong beak and large
strong feet. These are for tearing their prey.</p>

<p>As crows kill young chicks and pull up grain, farmers
dislike them. Have you not seen images placed
in fields, to scare the crows from the crops?</p>

<p>Crows are very noisy except when they are rearing a
young brood. Then they are quiet. They do not
wish the nest to be found. The nest is large and
made of moss, sticks, leaves, bark, and hairs. It
is built in a high tree. In it are four pale-green
eggs, with olive spots.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow helps brood the eggs. He keeps a sharp
lookout for danger for half a mile about his nest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
He hunts for food and brings some to Mrs. Crow
as she sits on her eggs.</p>

<p>Toward the end of summer, the young crows can fly
well. Then many families of crows go to pass
the night together in some place that they have
chosen. I used to like to watch great flocks of
crows going at sunset towards their roost. In the
morning they returned.</p>

<p>Crows like to live near the sea. They catch small fish.
They carry shell-fish high up in the air in their
claws, and let them drop on a rock. The fall
breaks the shells and the crows fly down and pick
out what is inside.</p>

<p>The jackdaw and the magpie are cousins of the crow.
They also eat flesh. They are larger than the
crow, and have some white in their plumage.
They can both be taught to speak.</p>

<p>The jackdaw likes to carry off and hide things. I
knew one that lived in a garden, where some
swans were kept on a pond. The naughty jackdaw
would go and carry off all the swans’ food
and hide it.</p>

<p>If we walked near his hiding-places, he would run
after us and peck our shoes. The gardener had
to put a wire fence all around the pond, and
clip the daw’s wings so that he could not fly
over the fence to rob the swans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>A much larger bird than these is the turkey buzzard.
He is about the size of a small turkey, and is of
a faded black color. His head and neck are bare
of feathers. The skin of the head and neck is
reddish and wrinkled. It has a little black hair
and down on it. The bill is very large and
hooked. The feet are also very large.</p>

<p>This is the least handsome of all our birds, and no
one likes it. The reason of the dislike is, the
bad odor the bird has. This odor comes from
the decayed animal food which the buzzard eats.
But it is this very habit of eating spoiled food
which makes the poor bird so useful to us.</p>

<p>The buzzard has a swift flight and a keen eye. It can
see its dead food far off. When you see three
or four buzzards wheeling in the air, you may be
sure that some dead animal lies on the ground
below them.</p>

<p>Any one who knows how the carcass of a sheep, cow,
dog, or cat will infect the air for miles about,
will feel glad that the buzzards like to eat such
things. The buzzards strip off all the ill-smelling
flesh, and leave only clean white bones.</p>

<p>The buzzard is a very mild, quiet bird. It never
fights, and never eats any live prey. It tears up
no corn, and carries off no little chicks. In most
States there is a law against killing a buzzard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>The buzzard makes no nest. It finds a hollow stump,
or a broken tree, and lays two or four eggs on the
decayed wood. The eggs are about the size of
goose eggs. They have brown spots on them.
The young ones are covered with down like
young goslings. Buzzards are American birds.</p>

<p>The large carrion crow, or black vulture, is a bird
much like the buzzard in its habits. But it lives
farther south, is seen in greater numbers, and is
not so shy. They are often tamed, and kept near
the markets to clean up offal. They like to sit on
the chimney tops to enjoy the warm air that rises.</p>

<p>Dogs and black vultures will feed together on a carcass.
But if the dogs crowd the birds too much,
the vultures will hiss at them. These black vultures
do good service by eating up alligators’ eggs.</p>

<p>Another of our brigade of flesh-eating birds is the
raven. The raven is a handsomer bird than the
others. His glossy black feathers have blue and
green tints on them. Ravens are often found in
sea-side cliffs and trees. They feed on dead fish.</p>

<p>The raven is noted as one of the most long-lived of birds.
They are said to live a hundred years. They are
found in nearly all climates and countries. While
they eat all kinds of dead animal matter, they
will also carry off young ducks and chickens.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BIRDS IN THE WOODS.</p>


<figure class="figleft illowp70" id="i_232" style="max-width: 112.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_232.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">UNDER THE TREES.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have told you
how the crows
chased a cat.
That was not
the only cat
chase I have
seen. One summer
I had a
house near a
wood. Through the wood ran a brook, and near
it was a marshy place. This is just such a spot
as birds love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>In that township no one was allowed to shoot birds, so
birds of many kinds were plentiful.</p>

<p>One day, as I stood on my porch, I heard a queer
noise. Then around the corner of the house
rushed a cat. After him, screaming, and flying
low, came about twenty birds. They were
headed by a blue jay. The jay flew down on the
cat, and gave him a sharp peck. He pulled out
some of the cat’s fur.</p>

<p>Among these birds I saw the robin, oriole, wren, catbird,
yellow-bird, yellow-hammer, blackbird, and
several sparrows. They may have their little
quarrels among themselves, but they all make
common cause when the cat prowls in the woods
to kill them.</p>

<p>Once, when I lived in the southwest, I had many forest
trees on my lawn. In these trees lived such birds
as I have just named, also the peewee, the titmouse,
and the bluebird. I had a tame squirrel
that went up the trees and frightened the birds.</p>

<p>After that they kept a sentinel always on a bough. If
the squirrel left the grass for any tree, the alarm
was sounded at once. Then all the birds near
came in haste, and attacked the squirrel. They
pecked and screamed at him, until he was glad to
keep out of the trees. Soon he did not dare to
touch a tree trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Among the wood birds the woodpecker is one of my
favorites. He is a very fine fellow. There are
many kinds of woodpeckers. We have the red-headed,
the yellow-breasted, the gold-winged, the
hairy, the downy, and others.</p>

<p>They are very intelligent, diligent, and merry birds.
They make their nests in holes in trees. It is
wonderful how they know where to find a decayed
spot in a tree that looks quite sound. The woodpecker
will eat fruit and grain, but prefers insects.
He, no doubt, saves many forest trees by eating
up grubs and worms, which would destroy them.</p>

<p>The woodpecker is a noisy bird. He is full of chatter
to his mate. He talks to himself constantly when
alone. His “drum” can be heard over all the
wood.</p>

<p>It is a fine sight to see him on a brown tree trunk.
His plumage, black, white, green, scarlet, gold, can
be seen from far. He whirls about, looking for
grubs. He holds fast with his strong claws, and
gives blow after blow with his great bill upon the
tree.</p>

<p>When he tears off a large piece of bark, and lays bare
a fine fat grub, he throws back his head, and
laughs with joy. He laughs almost as well as the
loon, of which I told you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>It seems a great shame to kill such a handsome and
happy bird. He really does very little harm, and
much good. Now and then, he carries off a pear
or an apple to eat, but he saves the lives of many
trees.</p>

<p>Among the joyous birds of the wood, let us now take
a look at the bird which is every one’s friend.
There is a bird that every one loves, and no one
says an ill word of. Can you guess that this is
the cheerful robin? He is our friend the year
round. His red vest shines against the summer
green and the winter snow.</p>

<p>The robin is a large bird, with black and brown head
and wings; most of the rest of the body is of a
dull, yellowish red. Of all our birds this is the
least shy. He is brave and merry, and goes and
comes as he pleases. Scarcely a month of the
year passes without bringing the robin.</p>

<p>Robins seem equally happy in wood, field, garden or
orchard. If they cannot find insects to eat, they
will take fruit, berries, crumbs or seeds. If food
grows scarce, they hop down to the door, and feed
with the chicks, or expect a fine breakfast thrown
out to them alone.</p>

<p>Some people think that robins eat fruit rather as drink
than as food. They take the fruit because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
are thirsty. It is said that if a pail of water is
set near the fruit trees, the birds will drink from
that and not rob the trees. You might try it
sometime, and find out if this is so.</p>

<p>The robin builds a large nest of straw and fibres. She
plasters it with mud, and lines it with fine grass.
She will come back to the same nest year after
year. In this nest she lays five eggs of a bright
blue-green color.</p>

<p>If the robin has taken a winter trip, he comes back
early in March to settle in the Northern and
Middle States. Sometimes he does not leave his
home in winter. Sometimes he goes and comes a
number of times, as if he wanted to keep an eye
on his house.</p>

<p>In March and April you see these birds in pairs. They
will be running about the short grass, hunting for
leaves, or sitting in the bare branches, trying a
song. The robin cannot sing so well as the thrush;
but he is fond of singing, and his note is merry if
not rich.</p>

<p>As soon as day breaks, you will hear the robin chorus.
All day long robin rests himself from work by
singing. In the wood he quarrels with no other
bird, and no other bird quarrels with him. The
robin can be seen in the autumn, feasting wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
there are poke or elder berries. He is a long-lived
bird, and, if he meets with no accident, may live
fifteen or eighteen years.</p>

<p>A larger and gayer bird than the robin, and living
often in the same wood, is the blue jay. I have
told you of some of this fine fellow’s naughty
ways. Did you ever see him? Did you notice
his big black bill, his great keen eyes, his saucy
crest, standing up like a helmet, his fine blue back,
his blue and white wings and tail, with black
bars? Oh, he is a kingly bird! And he knows it!</p>

<p>Of all our birds none is more pert and saucy than the
jay. His voice is loud, and he likes to hear it.
He is the trumpeter in the bird band. He has a
varied note, and can mock the songs of other
birds. He chatters like a duck; he screams like
an angry catbird; he whistles; he laughs; and
then he goes into the shade, and talks to his mate
in a soft musical tone.</p>

<p>He seems to be vain of his fine clothes. Sometimes
he stands on a branch, and makes such wild noises
that all the birds in the wood fly to see what is
the matter. Then, when he has a number of birds
to gaze at him, he bows, nods, jerks, flirts, whirls,
and makes all manner of the queerest motions.
He seems to be giving some sort of a show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>One of the jay’s family names is “the gabbler.” It is
said that, like the crow and some other birds, he
is a weather prophet, and most noisy before a
rain-storm.</p>

<p>The jay will eat almost any kind of food. He eats the
eggs and young of smaller birds. He eats chestnuts,
acorns, corn, cherries, insects. When very
hungry, he will take a small potato, or go to the
barn for corn and oats.</p>

<p>Of all the bird partners of the plant in seed-carrying,
the jay is chief. One man, who studied this bird
very carefully, said, “The jays are able, in a few
years’ time, to replant all our waste lands.” No
bird is more useful in carrying about nuts and
hard seeds.</p>

<p>The jay is especially the bird of North America. He
is not a very great traveller. Usually each pair
lives alone, and then with their young brood.
But sometimes in the autumn forty or fifty will
go together to look for acorns.</p>

<p>The jay likes to build in a quiet wood, near a stream.
He builds a large nest in a tree, and watches over
it, but does not often go very near it. The mother
jay lays five eggs of olive color, with brown spots.
When the young birds come from the shell, both
parents take great care of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>One day I saw in a wood five new-fledged jays, sitting
on a branch. They were not at all afraid of me.
But the old birds came near, and seemed in such
distress at seeing me, that I went away. A few
weeks after I saw the whole family, carrying
stores of chestnuts, acorns, and seeds to hide, for
they are given to laying up a hoard of food.</p>

<p>The jay is the great enemy of the owl. As soon as he
finds an owl hidden in the shade, he calls all the
other birds to the battle. Then, headed by the
jay, they scold and scream, and fly at the owl,
until they drive him off.</p>

<p>He quarrels also with the small sparrow-hawk. But in
that quarrel poor Mr. Jay sometimes is killed.
When he fights the hawk, he calls other jays to his
help. If one of them is killed by the hawk, they
all give loud, wild cries. Then they fly off and,
hidden in the wood, complain of their disaster.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BIRDS IN THE HOUSE.</p>


<p>As so many of you have cage birds, I think you will
like to hear a little about the kinds of birds that
most often live in cages. I will tell you of only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
the two most common kinds of pet birds,—the
canary and the parrot.</p>

<p>As the parrot is the larger bird and of more ancient
fame, we will speak of him first. Parrots have
been favorite cage birds for many hundred years.
They are notable for size, splendor of plumage,
docility, long life, and power of learning to speak.</p>

<p>Like the woodpecker, the parrot belongs to the division
of climbing birds. The feet of climbing birds
have two toes turned forward, and two turned
backward.</p>

<p>The parrot family is a group of large and splendid
birds. You will know even the smaller members
of it by their bills. The bills are high and thick,
and have the upper part much curved and longer
than the under part. This bill is useful in aiding
the birds in climbing, and in holding fast to the
branches of trees. It is just the right kind of bill
for eating fruit, which forms the chief food of the
parrot in its wild state.</p>

<p>The tongue of the parrot is short, thick, and fleshy.
The wings and tail are long. The plumage is gay.</p>

<p>To the parrot family belong the parrakeets, cockatoos,
macaws, and lories. These are all birds of hot
countries.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the splendor of the plumage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
these birds. Red, lemon, green, scarlet, blue,
white, and a mixture of these colors, will be found
upon them. Many of them have brilliant crests,
and many of them long gay tail feathers.</p>

<p>The head and bill of the parrot are large. While their
bill tells us what kind of food they live on, and
their feet show that they can climb, their long
strong wings show that they are birds of flight.</p>

<p>Parrots are social birds. They live in large flocks.
They make their nests in hollow trees, as woodpeckers
do. In their native homes they are much
like woodpeckers in some of their ways. But they
eat fruit, not insects.</p>

<p>The natural voice of the parrot is a loud, harsh call.
Parrots can learn to speak only when they are
carefully taught. Not every kind of parrot can
learn even when taught. The common short-tailed,
red and green parrot makes the best talker.
Some of them are very amusing.</p>

<p>Parrots are usually of a kind, gentle disposition, easily
tamed, and learn to live very happily in a cage.
When captive they eat sugar, crackers, and almost
any little dainty that is offered to them. They
are fond of water, and bathe often.</p>

<p>The very long-tailed parrots called macaws, and parrakeets,
are birds of Central and Southern America.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
In India there are also very long-tailed parrots.
In old times they were sent as presents to kings
and queens. The parrakeets of Asia and Africa
are called ring parrakeets, because each one has
a collar of bright feathers about the neck. The
two parrots called “the gray,” and “the festive,”
or “jolly” parrot, are the most common as pets,
are most amusing, and learn many words and
tricks.</p>

<p>What are called “love birds” are very small and beautiful
parrots, from North Africa. They are as
small as bluebirds. They are the smallest of their
race, and rather rare.</p>

<p>The cockatoos are kept in cages, not for their speech, as
they do not learn to talk, but for their great
beauty. You will know them by their high
crests. They have their name from their note,
or call. They are natives of tropic islands.
Most of them have light-colored feathers, pink,
lemon or white, with markings of brighter tints.</p>

<p>If you live where you can visit a large bird-store, you
will do well to go to see some of these birds.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to that other house bird, and common
pet, the canary.</p>

<p>This little bird has its name from some islands on the
coast of Africa, which are its native home. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
about three hundred years since these birds began
to be reared and sold for cage birds.</p>

<p>Canaries are very small birds, of a delicate yellow
color, graceful shape, bright and lively ways, and
sweet song.</p>

<p>In their native woods they have not the clear yellow
color which they now wear. They are of an olive
green with spots of black and yellow. The yellow
color has become common to the cage birds.</p>

<p>Canaries are intelligent, affectionate little birds. They
can be taught to whistle tunes, if you train them
with care and patience. If given plenty of water,
clean cages, plenty of light, and good fresh seed,
they will be healthy and live a long time.</p>

<p>You should give them a lump of sugar for a treat, some
chick-weed for fresh food, a bit of cuttle-fish bone
to sharpen their beak upon. You must also be
careful to keep them out of a draught.</p>

<p>These birds of hot lands, reared in cages, would die if
we let them fly out of the cage. So, if we treat
them well, it does not seem cruel to keep them in
their little wire palaces.</p>

<p>For my part, I prefer to see birds flying, feeding, and
singing in the woods and fields, which are their
natural home.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE LOST BIRDS.</p>


<p>Hidden in the earth, in peat swamps, or in rocks, we
find the bones of birds of various kinds that lived
long ago, and are now lost. Some of these lost
birds were on the earth before men and beasts
were. Others have been well known until a recent
time. I shall tell you of a few that have
lived until lately.</p>

<p>First I shall mention the great auk. This was a large
handsome bird, which lived along the shores and
islands of northern seas. As auks were good to
eat, large numbers of them were killed.</p>

<p>There should have been a law to protect them while
they were raising their young. As there was no
such law, the birds were killed at any time, and
their eggs and young were taken. Thus year by
year they perished, until none are left.</p>

<p>The auk was a very large bird, with black and white
feathers. It had very short legs, broad, webbed
feet, and very small wings. When sitting at rest
on a rock, it held itself straight up and was
nearly a yard high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>It was a wonderful swimmer and diver, but could not
walk much, and did not fly except from rock to
rock. Its bill was very large and strong. The
auk was a fish-catcher and eater.</p>

<p>As to these very big bills, such as you see on the toucan
and hornbill in museums, where the bill is
nearly as large as all the rest of the bird, let me
tell you a secret. Do not they look very heavy?
Do you not wonder how the bird can carry them,
or fly with them?</p>

<p>Here is the truth. The horny hard part is very thin,
not thicker than a sheet of paper. Then all the
inside of the bill is built up in cells, something
like a fine honey-comb, and these cells are full of
air! So instead of being heavy, these huge bills
are very light.</p>

<p>The bill of the auk was large, but not nearly so large
as that of the hornbill or toucan.</p>

<p>A neighbor of the auk was the Labrador duck. This
bird often built its nest close by where the auk
laid its great, bright-colored eggs, near the water’s
edge. The Labrador duck and the auk swam in
the same waters, and were both very gentle birds.</p>

<p>This duck, like the auk, is now lost. The last one
seems to have been killed a few years ago. The
Labrador duck was a very beautiful bird. People<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
wanted its eggs, flesh and feathers, and did not
spare the old birds to raise their broods.</p>

<p>This makes me think of the fable of the greedy man,
who killed the goose that laid golden eggs. Then
he had neither goose nor eggs. I think it served
him right.</p>

<p>Chief among lost birds is the famous dodo. This dodo
was an immense pigeon. It was a helpless, quiet,
kind, clumsy bird. It was too heavy and too
short of wing to fly. It had no weapon of defence;
no sharp, strong bill; no tearing claws.</p>

<p>Such a bird was easily caught and torn to pieces by
dogs or cats. When these animals were taken to
the island of Mauritius, where the dodo lived,
they were allowed to run wild in the woods.
They soon became more like wolves and panthers
than decent dogs and cats.</p>

<p>The dodo had never before seen any wild animals
larger than rats or squirrels. The dodos lived in
peace and friendship with other birds and small
wild beasts. When ships began to visit the islands
where the poor dodos lived, men, dogs, and cats
soon put an end to the gentle birds.</p>

<p>Lost, with the auk and dodo, we may count two kinds
of beautiful parrots, and a starling with a splendid
crest, like an unfurled fan; also a tall, handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
bird, called a rail, has been hunted out of
existence. But some other rails are still plentiful.</p>

<p>The last bird to disappear has been the great vulture
of the Alps. This was a big bird indeed. It was
two yards wide across the outspread wings. It
lived on the high peaks of the Alps.</p>

<p>This bird had a large hooked beak and large strong
claws. You know that eagles and vultures are
flesh eaters. This big vulture did not confine its
diet to dead flesh. It would pick up and carry
off a little lamb. It has been known, also, to
carry off a baby child.</p>

<p>So, as this was a cruel and dangerous bird, I am glad
it has gone from the earth.</p>

<p>The garefowl, often called a penguin, is another lost
bird. It was a great bird, living on the coast.
It had such small wings that it could not fly.
Thus you see it could not get away from dogs
and wild animals, except when it could take to
the water.</p>

<p>When men joined in the hunt, the garefowl soon perished.
Is it not right, then, to kill birds for food?
Yes. But they should never be killed until the
season is over when they are laying eggs and
raising the young brood. If old birds are killed
before the young ones are reared, you can see that
the birds must soon die out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Then, too, while birds may be killed for food, it is not
right to kill them for the mere pleasure of killing.
It is wrong to find a pleasure in taking away life.
You should never waste the life of beast, bird,
insect, or plant.</p>

<p>I have seen people nearly destroy a variety of rare
wild flower, by tearing up masses of the plant
before seeds had time to form. The people took
much that they did not need and soon threw
away. Then only few and small plants were left
for seed.</p>

<p>We should remember that as we are not the first people
on the earth, so we shall not be the last, and
we should not rob the future of things that are
pleasing to us. We should all try to make the
earth richer and better, not poorer, for our having
been in it.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FIN FAMILY.</p>


<p>I remember when I thought that no living thing was
of so little interest as a fish. I used to wonder
how it was that the great Agassiz began his studies
in Nature with fish. I did not think that fish
were even pretty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>I suppose that was because I knew nothing about them.
When we are quite ignorant of a subject, we are
apt to think it has no interest.</p>

<p>One reason why, in these Nature Readers, I am telling
you something of many things is, that by
knowing a little of these subjects, your interest in
them may be aroused. Then you will try to learn
more; and the more you know, the more you will
enjoy.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_249.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">IN THE COOL DEPTHS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once, if you had asked me, “What is a fish?” I should
have said, “Oh, a fish is a long thing, with scales
and fins; and it lives in the water!” How many
of you can tell me anything more than that?
Perhaps you will add that a fish is good to eat.</p>

<p>Well, one day I went into a house where there was a
great glass tank. It was like a glass room full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of water. As I stood looking in through the
glass side of this tank, I saw, gliding through the
water, a large, lovely creature, in silver and rose
color. It had big black eyes, set in a golden ring.</p>

<p>This creature seemed to move without the least effort.
It made no sound. It slid by me like the figures
in a beautiful dream. It rose. It turned. It
sank,—and all without seeming to exert itself in
the least. I saw no effort at motion; but now and
then a tremor of a forked tail, and now and then
the gentle wave to and fro of a pair of gleaming,
thin, silken things, like fans, half unfurled.</p>

<p>This, then, was a fish at home! Here was a fish living
in the water, and doing as it pleased. The clear
water added to its beauty. It shone like a gem.
Other creatures, as beautiful, but different, lived
with it. They crossed and recrossed each other’s
course. They left no track. They had no path.
They moved on, far more easily than a bird moves
in the air, or a man on the land.</p>

<p>From that day I loved the fin family. Let us look at
this family.</p>

<p>I told you that a bird is built on the plan of a boat to
sail in the air. The fish, also, is built on the boat
plan. He is a boat to move not <i>on</i>, but <i>in</i>, the
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps this is not a fair way of speaking; for birds
and fish were made long before men. And no
doubt men built their boats on the plan of the
water-birds and the fish.</p>

<p>The fishes vary much in shape and size. We will
speak now of the ordinary fish type. We will take
a model or pattern fish, such as the perch or the
mackerel.</p>

<p>The head is sharp and wedge-shaped. It serves as the
prow of the boat, to divide the water. The body
is long, narrow, smooth. It has scales lapping
over each other, and are all turned from the head
toward the tail.</p>

<p>The tail is like the rudder of a boat, to direct its course.
It serves also as the paddle, or propeller, to drive
it through the water. There is a long slim fin on
each side, just below and behind the head. These
serve as balances, and, also, sometimes as oars.</p>

<p>There is a long fin, sometimes there are two fins, on
the ridge of the back. There are also two fins on
the lower line of the body. These steady the fish
in the water. They help to keep it, as you would
say, “right side up.” There are two more fins
under the body, near the tail. What you call the
tail is really a fin. The true tail is the narrow
end of the body, just above this final fin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>Let us look at the head. Just on the front is the
mouth. It has plenty of teeth. I shall tell you
of these teeth in another lesson, when I tell
you about the scales. Just above and behind the
mouth are the eyes, one on each side of the head.
They never have any eyelids.</p>

<p>Below and back of the eyes are the gills and gill-covers.
Gills are wonderful things, which serve the fish
for lungs. These gills can take, or sift, out of the
water, the oxygen of the air that is mixed with
the water.</p>

<p>The fish takes the water in at his mouth. Then, by a
motion like swallowing, he drives it out through
the gills; and the gills sift out the oxygen, as the
water passes through them. Fish need that part
of air called oxygen to purify their blood, just as
you need it.</p>

<p>If fish are kept in a vase where the water is not renewed,
they soon die for lack of oxygen. If they
are put into water which has been boiled, they
die, because boiling has driven out the oxygen.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have been told that fish breathe water, as
you breathe air. That is not true. Fish breathe
air, but the air must be sifted through their fine
gills. When you pull a fish out of water, he pants
and struggles and cannot get his breath. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
fine gills stick together, and cannot do their work.
So the fish chokes to death. His panting action
is an effort to get air.</p>

<p>Fish with the thinnest and finest gills, as herring,
choke very soon. A carp, perch, or other fish
that have gill-covers that will hold moisture, and
gills that will keep wet a long time, will live one,
two, or more hours in the air.</p>

<p>Fish have inside the body an air-bladder, or bag of air.
This may help them in breathing, but its chief use
is to keep them up in the water. The bladder lies
under the backbone. This backbone runs from
the head to the tail of the fish. It is made of
little pieces like cups. Each piece has two or
more long spines, like ribs, on each side of it.</p>

<p>The bony frame of a fish is very curious. You should
try to have a fish skeleton to look at. There are
little bones that extend from each division of the
fins. You will see that the skeleton looks somewhat
like the ribs or frame of a boat before the
planks are put on.</p>

<p>The bright color and gleam of the fish is in the scales.
I will tell you of these later. The scales are like
a rich, flexible suit of armor.</p>

<p>Fish have cold blood, not warm like yours. They have
very keen sight and smell. Probably they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
good hearing, and but little sense of touch or
taste. They have small brains, and not very much
intelligence.</p>

<p class="ph3">OUTSIDE AND INSIDE.</p>


<p>If I ask you what is the largest of all fish, you will
say “a whale.” But let me tell you that a whale
is not a fish. A whale is an animal that spends
all its time <i>in</i> the water, but cannot live constantly
<i>under</i> water. If cast ashore it will die, because it
has no means of getting back into the water, and
no food on the land.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_254" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_254.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">QUEER NOSES.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>But whales have no gills, and they breathe air as you
do. They are so made that they can, with safety,
remain under water for a much longer time than
you can. If a whale is kept under water too long,
he drowns. So we must leave whales, nar-whales,
and porpoises out of our account of fishes.</p>

<p>Among real fish you will find some of great size.
Sturgeon have been caught which weighed five
hundred pounds. They were twelve or fourteen
feet long. Yet this size seems small when we
compare it with that of the great shark which
has been found thirty feet long.</p>

<p>A queer contrast with such a vast creature is the little
minnow, which you catch in ponds and brooks.
It is not much over an inch long. Little English
boys in their first fishing trips go for sticklebacks,
a fish from one to two inches long. I shall tell
you in another lesson of this amusing little fish.</p>

<p>The fish usually chosen as a type, or model, of the fish
race, is a perch. We find fishes<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> differing from
the general perch pattern as much as flower differs
from flower.</p>

<p>The perch is a wedge-shaped fish, and is a beautiful
creature. Let us see how others of the fin family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
differ from the pattern I described to you in the
last lesson.</p>

<p>Instead of having a clear, round, full, bright eye
like that of a perch, some fishes, which live in
mud, or in very deep water, have tiny eyes, like
dots. Some fishes which live in streams in dark
caves have really no eyes.</p>

<p>The perch is covered with scales of a rich green-brown
and a golden white. Some fish, as the eel and
sword-fish, have no scales. A shark has no true
scales, but his skin has hardened into little bony
points. Some other fish, instead of scales, have
large bony plates. The heads and the fins seldom
have any scales upon them.</p>

<p>If you could see a large collection of fish, you would
wonder at the variety of shape. You would see
the “perch pattern” changed in almost every possible
way. Perhaps the first odd-shaped family to
notice would be the rays.</p>

<p>The fish of this family are flat. Their bodies are
shaped much like a flat triangle, finished with a
long slim tail. The ray’s mouth is on the under
side of his body. The most common members of
the ray family are the skates. They are of a dark
color above, and light below. I shall soon tell
you a queer thing about skates’ eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>One of the rays is called the sting ray, because its tail
extends in a huge lash, like an immense whip.
Another ray is called the eagle, because his body
and fins widen out on each side, like the wings
of a big bird.</p>

<p>Another odd-shaped fin family is that of the flat fish.
These, like the rays, are dark above and light
below. These fish are very flat or thin in the body,
and usually have both eyes and mouth on the
upper or dark side. There is one kind where the
eyes and mouth are so raised as to look much
like the head of a bird. They swim with a queer
wave-like motion of the whole body. To this
family belong the turbot, flounder, plaice, and sole.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is a family of fish that are nearly as
round as balls. They have wide stripes of light
and dark color, and look more like nice play bells,
furnished with tails and fins, than like fish.</p>

<p>A queer contrast to them is the pipe-fish. Pipe-fish
have no scales. Their bodies are long and slender,
like very slim canes. They get their name from
the queer shape of their noses. The pipe-fish’s nose
is very slim and hard, and half as long as the fish.
People think it looks like a pipe, or cigar.</p>

<p>Many fish have very odd noses. Instead of the wedge-shaped
head, with the nose and mouth set exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
on the front, the nose may be of a queer shape,
and the mouth above or below.</p>

<p>The bellows-fish gets its name from a nose shaped
almost exactly like a bellows. One kind of sturgeon
is called the shovel-fish, because its head is
shaped much like a wide shovel. Another sturgeon
is called the spoon-bill, because its nose runs out
in a long, horny plate, like a spoon, or a paddle.
The hammer-headed shark, has its head broadened
on each side like a great hammer, with the
neck for a handle. One eye is set at the end of
each projection.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you of all the queer shapes that fish
take. If you examine those which you catch in
the ponds and rivers, or see brought to market,
you will observe that no two kinds are alike.
What a narrow, graceful, active fish a trout is!
What a queer little fellow is the fish that from
his shape you call “a pumpkin seed.”</p>

<p>I told you just now, that one ray fish has a very long
tail. With it he strikes, and stuns or kills, his
prey, or his enemy. Most fish live on animal food.
Some fish eat sea-weeds, but most of them prefer
other fish, crabs, insects, shell-fish, or other live
creatures. Very many fish have some weapon for
securing prey, or fighting their enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Some fish, depend on their quickness of motion to
secure their food or escape enemies. But I will
now tell you of some of their weapons. The lower
lip of a salmon turns up into a sharp, cutting hook.
The sword-fish has a long, hard, sharp, strong
horn, which it can drive into the side of a ship.
With this weapon it will also kill a man. The
sword is formed by some bones of the side of
the head, growing out very long and strong.
The sword-fish belongs to the ray order.</p>

<p>Another ray is the saw-fish. This fish carries on its
head a long, flat bone set with great points like
the teeth of a coarse saw. With this weapon the
saw-fish charges into a shoal of fishes. He maims
and wounds a number so that they die or cannot
swim away. Then he feasts on them at his
leisure.</p>

<p>A very queer fish is the torpedo.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He is a very big
fellow. He can give a shock like electricity,
that stuns or kills his prey. There is a large
eel which has the same power. They are both
much feared by other fishes.</p>

<p>But no fish is more feared by other fish, or by men,
than the shark. No doubt you have heard of him,
with his huge mouth set with great hooked teeth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
He can kill almost any creature which is in
the sea.</p>

<p>While much more could be said about weapons, we
must now leave them to take a look at the first
pair of fins, or the breast fins.</p>

<p>In the rays the breast fins are broad and long. They
are the chief means of swimming. The flat fish
have these breast fins extended all along the side
of the body. By the wave-like motion of these
fins and of the body they swim.</p>

<p>In some fish these breast fins are turned to feet, for
walking at the bottom of the water. There are
one or two kinds of fish that can climb trees.
These have the under fins turned to sucker-like
plates to help them climb.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of the flying fish? That fish has
the breast fins long and wide like wings. The
fish can rise from five to twenty feet above the
water, and these fin wings support it, so that it
can fly about two hundred yards. Thus it escapes
from its enemies.</p>

<p>You will see some fish with fleshy, finger-like organs
near the mouth. These are called barbels. Fish
with barbels are bottom feeders. With these barbels
they hunt for food in the mud.</p>

<p class="ph3">WHERE THEY LIVE.</p>


<p>Where does the fin family live? “In the water,” you
say. Yes. There is perhaps no natural body of
water in the world without its fish. There are
forty families of fresh-water fish. There are fish
that live in water that is partly salt and partly
fresh, as where the sea-tides run back into rivers.
There are fish that live in the salt water of the
ocean.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_261" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_261.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">IN FRESH WATER.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>The ocean fish are divided into three classes. First
there are the coast fish, that seldom go far from
shore. They need a certain kind of food and a
certain warmth of water that they find near land.
Then there are surface, or upper-sea fish, that live
far from land, but never very deep in the water.
And there are the fish of the very deep sea.</p>

<p>The surface, or upper-sea fish, are most of them very
strong swimmers. The deep-sea fish live far down
where there is little air and almost no light. It
is only about twenty years since people began to
study deep-sea fish, and as yet little is known
about them.</p>

<p>Many of the shore, or coast fish, that live in sea-water,
enter the rivers to lay their eggs. They arrive
in the rivers in the spring, and sometimes go up
even hundreds of miles from the mouth to find
safe places for their young. Thus these fish are
born in fresh water, and grow up in salt water.</p>

<p>Among fish of this habit, we find the shad and the
salmon. So you see a fish may live part of its
time in salt water, part of the time in fresh, and
part of the time in the brackish water at the
river’s mouth. Some fish, that are accustomed to
spend all their lives in sea-water, can be made to
live in fresh water, if this is changed gradually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>When fish live in a tank, air must be driven into the
water to supply what the fish use out of it. If
air is not driven in, the fish will die. As the oxygen
in the water becomes scarce, the fish seem
uneasy. They come up to the top of the water,
and put their mouths out for air. They give a
gasp as if choking.</p>

<p>In such tanks, where fish live, a jet of water is driven
with some force into the water of the tank from
above. As it goes down, you see a stream of
shining bubbles. These bubbles are air. They
break in the water, and the air mingles with the
water in the tank.</p>

<p>You may see gold-fish in globes coming to the top of
the water, and seeming uneasy and unhappy.
Then if you dash in a little fresh water, or take
some of the water from the globe and pour it back
from a little height, the fish seem content.</p>

<p>You know that the driving winds and the tumbling
waves that break in foam will keep plenty of
fresh air in ocean water, for all the finny tribes
that live there.</p>

<p>So rivers, as they rush and ripple, toss their waves,
and are driven with winds, get air bubbles mixed
in their waters.</p>

<p>Some fish need more air than others, and often come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
to the surface to breathe. Some, as the sturgeon,
leap above the surface into the air. Perhaps you
have seen cat-fish jumping in this way. Did you
ever see dolphins and porpoises<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> roll themselves
quite above the surface of the water in their play?
I have told you of the fish that make short flights.
In all these ways these creatures help themselves
to air in their water home. But what do they
do for food?</p>

<p>As I told you, fish eat fish and insects and crabs and
such living things. Some few are feeders on vegetables.
Fish will also devour almost anything
that is thrown into the water for them. Did you
ever feed fish in a pond with bread and worms?</p>

<p>Carp will hurry to the top of the water to get food
that they have learned to look for when people
come near. Fish of a kind often keep together
and feed together. You know in a stream there
may be some places where you will catch only
trout, or only bullheads. And in some other
place you will find pickerel.</p>

<p>In the sea you will find millions of herring together at
certain seasons. This is called a shoal of herring.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
Fish move from place to place along many miles
of sea-coast or river, as they seek their especial
food, or a certain warmth.</p>

<p>Sometimes a particular fish, or pair of fishes, will live
for years in some certain place. They may find a
nice spot under a bank, where they feel safe, and
where plenty of food drifts near them.</p>

<p>I knew of a fish that went into a hole made by the
roots of a great willow-tree. The roots formed a
close cage about him. He liked it well. His enemies
could not get at him. Water rippled in and
out about him. Grubs and worms were close to
his mouth. He grew fat and big. He grew so
big he could not get out. He began to grow to fit
the shape of his cage. As he had no room to
grow long, he grew broad.</p>

<p>After some years he was a very queer-looking fish.
Finally, some men were making an embankment,
and they came upon this fish-home in the roots of
the tree. They took the fish out with care, and
sent him to a pond. I fancy it seemed odd to him
to swim at first, after being so long a prisoner.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of fish that live and thrive in
the icy-cold waters of polar seas. There are other
fish that live in hot springs or ponds, where the
water is so hot that you can hardly bear your
hand in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Some fish can live only in very clean water. Others
live in black and muddy streams, and their flesh
takes the dark hue of their home. In fact, there
seem to be some kinds of fish made to suit every
kind of water. This is very fortunate, as so
many birds and beasts and so many people eat
fish.</p>

<p class="ph3">HOW THEY BEHAVE.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_266.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">ABOVE THE WAVE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Birds, beasts, and insects live where we can easily
watch them. Wherever we go, they are our near
neighbors. We can easily find out many facts
about their way of living. For this reason, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
people, from the earliest times, have observed
these creatures, and have written down what they
learned about them.</p>

<p>But of fish, people have been able to see and know
much less. It has taken much longer to learn
about creatures that hide in the waters, and are,
for the most part, out of our sight. Seeing fish
so much less often, people took less interest in
them.</p>

<p>Since great aquariums were built with glass tanks, in
which fish can live at ease and behave in a natural
way, we have learned more of their habits.</p>

<p>These tanks are filled with salt or fresh water, as the
fish may require. The floor of the tank is covered
with sand, rock, shells. Then crabs and small
“shell-fish” of many kinds, and larvæ and worms
are put in, such as the fish would find in their
native homes.</p>

<p>Caves and grottos, lined with moss and weeds, are
built; and the tank looks like a true part of a
river, pond, or sea. Then the water is kept at
the right warmth, and fresh air is driven in as I
have told you. The light is made just right for
the fish in the tank, and proper kinds of fish are
put together.</p>

<p>When you go and stand outside of one of these great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
tanks, this water world is before you from top to
bottom. Now I shall tell you some of the things
which I learned about how fish behave at home.</p>

<p>By such a tank I first learned that nothing can be
more easy and full of grace and majesty than the
motion of a fish in the water.</p>

<p>I watched a great fish swimming. I could not see the
motion of a muscle, or the least quiver of fin or
tail. His great round eyes shone; his splendid
red fins were still; his spotted back glistened
through the waves; his broad sides gleamed in
silver mail.</p>

<p>He never seemed to stir from his majestic calm. He
stole across the line of vision, but without visible
effort. He crossed the path of other fish. He
sailed above them or below them; but he seemed
to feel himself all alone, and to notice nothing.</p>

<p>A fisher who had watched pike told me that, when he
watched one lying in a pool, he was sure that the
fish saw him. It did not seem to make any
motion. But the fish changed its place. Soon it
was gone.</p>

<p>In the next tank to the one I spoke of, were flounders.
They swam with a wave-like motion of the whole
body. They did not swim straight forward. They
went up and down in curves. Their motion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
much like the flight of short-winged, heavy birds.
In fact, a sole which had its eyes and mouth set
upon a kind of skull-shaped head, on the upper
side of the flat body, looked much like a dim,
first idea of a bird.</p>

<p>The fish in the tank were not fish that fed on each
other, and they never seemed to notice each other
at all.</p>

<p>I saw some kinds of fish asleep. A dog-fish lay asleep
on the sand, with his nose in a corner, for half a
day. He looked as if he were dead. Three
hermit crabs<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> were crawling about over him. He
never stirred. He did not seem to notice their
sharp claws and their jostling shells.</p>

<p>This sleeping of the dog-fish reminded me of what I
had seen in pools where fish lie basking in the
sunshine. Some fish are very fond of lying in a
sunny spot. Others will get into a shadow, and
lie there with great content.</p>

<p>I found in my study of fish life in tanks, that fish are
given to fighting. Some of them fight with their
nearest relatives. In a small tank I saw two fish
that fought and bit each other so cruelly that
they had to be parted.</p>

<p>There had been several fish in this tank, and all but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
two had been killed in their battles. Then a glass
partition had been put in the middle of the tank,
and one fish lived on each side. They swam up
to this clear wall, laid their noses against it, and
glared at each other.</p>

<p>Another fact I remarked in fish is the clearness and
keenness of their vision, and the quick way in
which they will dart at food. When they see
something that they wish to eat dropping down
through the water, they spring at it with open
mouths, and seem never to miss their mark.</p>

<p>When they need more air than they can get from the
water, they swim to the surface and take a gulp
of air and water. When they are sick, they do
not swim, but lie on their sides, as if they feel too
weak to make any effort. When they are dead,
the bodies turn over and float on their backs.</p>

<p>It is said that fish can reproduce parts that they have
lost, as crabs and star-fish can. At least, they
can easily live when an eye or part of their mouth
or a fin is gone. They seem to suffer little from
such a loss. A fish that has a wound, or has just
lost an eye, will swim about and eat as if it felt
no pain.</p>

<p>Some fishes that live on the bottom have a queer way
of lying close on the sand, with their mouths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
wide open. They pant as if in great pain. But
they are not in pain, they are sifting their food
out of the water.</p>

<p>Look into their throats, and you will see a network,
like fine bones. That is their sieve to catch small
food.</p>

<p>Some fish are timid, and hide at the least sound.
Others are fearless, and lie in plain view, or boldly
follow their prey. A fish darting after his food is
a fine sight. His jaws are open; his spines stand
in a ridge on his back; his eyes gleam. His
whole body seems alert and full of fire.</p>

<p>You should watch fish for yourselves. You have seen
gold and silver fish in globes. Other fish are
often kept in ponds and fountains as pets. They
become very tame. Sometimes they learn to know
those who feed them, and will come when called.</p>

<p>A fish comes from an egg, as a bird does. There are
one or two kinds that are born as little live
fishes. But the rule is that the fishes hatch out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of tiny eggs. The mother fish drops these eggs
in the water, or carefully lays them in some place
which she prepares for them.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_272" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_272.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A CURIOUS CRADLE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After they are laid, these eggs are called spawn. Before
they are laid, they lie in a solid mass together.
There are many thousands of them in
each mass, and they are then called roe. I have
told you of the wonderful number of eggs laid by
insects. But fish surpass even the insects in the
number of eggs.</p>

<p>These eggs are subject to very many dangers. Fish,
crabs, and water-fowls eat them. The waves may
dash them ashore, and so they will be dried up.
Therefore it is needful that there should be a
great many, so that after all disasters a large
number may hatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The eggs of fish are of a pearly white, or a cream color.
They are covered with a kind of glue, so that they
stick together. They also stick to weeds, or rock,
or sand, where they are laid.</p>

<p>There are very few fish that carry their eggs about
with them, after they are laid. The fish presses
its body against the eggs, which stick to it, and
are carried about, until they hatch. You have
read of the crab which took care of its eggs in
this way.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>As the little fish grows within the egg, the soft skin-like
case becomes very thin. When the time
comes for hatching, the little fish breaks the case,
and comes out. As a general rule, the little fish,
just out of the egg, looks and acts like the parent
fish. But there are some that change much between
their first and their full-grown states.</p>

<p>Let us now look at some curious fish eggs and fish
nests. Of all the fin family, the dog-fish has the
most curious cradle for its young. The egg-case
of the dog-fish is a horny bag, or purse. It is of
a gray or blackish color, about an inch wide, and
two inches long. At each of the four corners,
it has a long, stiff, curly stem.</p>

<p>The mother dog-fish swims near the shore to lay her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
eggs. She selects a weed, branch, or piece of tree,
lying in the water. To this she ties her egg-cases
by means of their long stems, or strings. She
does this by swimming round and round the twig
to which she means to fasten the case. As she
drops the case in the water, she ties it, or binds it,
by drawing with her the curly ends, as she swims,
about the branch.</p>

<p>She lays a number of these purses in a place. Then
she swims off and leaves them. It is lucky that
she does, for if she stayed near them, she would
eat the little fish as soon as they came out!</p>

<p>I have seen a dog-fish tying its eggs to a branch lying
under water, and it was a queer sight. When the
baby fish has grown large enough to leave the
case, it makes a little opening on one end, and
creeps out.</p>

<p>The skate, that is a cousin of the dog-fish, lays a case
much like this. But the case of the skate is of
a shape more nearly square. It has four sharp,
curved horns, not long, curly ends; and the little
skate comes out of a hole in the middle, never at
the end.</p>

<p>Another sea-fish, the mackerel, has no such protection
for its eggs. It drops thousands of them on the
water, and they look like tiny pearl beads. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
sink to the bottom. As they are sticky, they
cling together, and to the sand, until they hatch.</p>

<p>That prettiest of fish, the trout, which lives in so many
clear, shady streams, where there are deep, quiet
pools to bask in, is very careful of her eggs. The
mother trout sinks to the bottom of some clean
stream, and selects a nice sandy place. Then,
with her tail, she fans out all the coarse sand and
gravel. If there are larger bits of pebble, she
carries them off in her mouth.</p>

<p>When she has made a nice smooth little nest, like a
cup, she drops her eggs into it. Then she covers
them lightly with gravel, so that they will not be
floated away. When she has finished one nest,
she swims off to make another.</p>

<p>The black bass of our lakes and ponds makes a smooth
bed for its eggs. It prepares this bed in the
shadow of a stone or sunken log. Several bass
will go together, and select and clear out such a
bed. Then they will lay their eggs there, and
for days, until the eggs hatch, will swim about
near, to keep watch over them. Eels, cat-fish,
perch, and suckers, come to eat these eggs, and
the big bass drive them away.</p>

<p>The pretty perch does not take such care as this of her
eggs. She drops them in long chains, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
grasses, and leaves of water-plants, at the edge
of the pond. When the yellow cowslips are in
bloom, you can find these eggs among the water-plants,
like strings of fairy beads.</p>

<p>When the baby perch come from the eggs, they are
very nimble, and begin at once to eat. When
they are no longer than the nail of your little
finger, it is funny to see them in the water, darting
after the living atoms that serve them for food.</p>

<p>They see and know these tiny things in the water, and
pounce upon them with wide-open mouths.</p>

<p>The little fish, from the time they are out of the egg,
until they are about half grown, are called fry.
Some fish, as the salmon, get different names at
different periods of their growth. A great many
fish together are called a school. Thousands of
fish will come leaping, rolling, and tumbling along
in the water, and we say it is a school of fish.</p>

<p class="ph3">SCALES AND TEETH.</p>


<p>I told you that most fish had scales, and that these
scales clothed them in a gleaming, flexible suit
of armor. Most of the beautiful color of fish is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
found upon their scales. Many of the scales are
iris or rainbow hued. That is, they have the gleam
of many colors, according as the light strikes
them. Have you not seen such colored light in a
glass prism?</p>

<p>The scales of different fish vary in shape, size, color,
and hardness. In general, they are horny like your
finger nail, but thinner. Their shape is nearly
round, much like a rose petal. They are fastened
by the smaller edge to the skin of the fish. Then
each scale laps over the next one, and so on.</p>

<p>Scales are always so set that they turn or lap, from the
head toward the tail. In the middle of each scale,
on the lateral or side line of the fish, is a little
groove or canal. It runs in the direction of a line
from head to tail. Let us see what it is for.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how slippery fishes are? Is it not
hard to hold them? If you rub your finger hard
down their bodies, you rub off a quantity of slime,
or stuff like glue, or thin paste. This glue-like
stuff is made near the mouth of the fish. It is
supplied to the scales by little tubes near the
mouth. It runs through that little canal in each
scale in a line upon the side of the fish.</p>

<p>This slimy stuff helps the fish to slide easily through
the water. It keeps the scales limber and healthy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
It keeps the body supple. It helps the fish to slip
away from creatures that seize it. Also, I am sure,
it helps the fish to slide easily down the throats
of birds, animals, or fish that capture it!</p>

<p>The fact that the scales all lie turned from the head to
the tail of the fish, also makes it easy for birds or
other fish to swallow it. But if a fish is partly
swallowed, it cannot be readily cast out, for its
scales rising, make a rough surface, and hinder it.
I suppose that was why the alwife duck I told
you of could not get the partly swallowed fish out
of her throat.</p>

<p>Each kind of fish has its own especial shape and color
of scales. Some are pointed, some are rounded,
some are flat, some are curved, some are three-cornered.
Some fish have no scales. Some have
such tiny ones that you will not notice them unless
you look sharp. Some fish, as the sturgeon, have
great bony plates, like large limpet shells, laid in
lines up and down the body.</p>

<p>Fish not only have their own especial shape of scales,
but their especial color, and such colors have their
especial place on the fish. One flat, brown fish has
all the under side of its body white, but spots of
red, like sealing wax, are laid all over the brown
side, as if you had dropped red wax upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>When you see a smoked and salted herring hung up
for sale, you are not likely to guess what a beautiful
thing it was, when living in its water home.
It had a coat of blue, green, and silver, and gem-like
eyes. The eye of a dead fish is sunken and
dull. The eye of a living fish is full, and gleaming
with light.</p>

<p>There is a little fish called a wrasse which looks as if
made out of a rainbow. It is dressed in bright
blue, gold, bronze, and white.</p>

<p>The red bream is of a fine rose-red color, with silver
sides. Its luminous eyes are set in golden rings.
The perch has dark, shining bands on its silver
coat, and it has gay, red fins. The gray mullet is
a quaker fish, trim, grave, quiet in its style, but
lovely in its shape and in the rainbow lights along
parts of its body.</p>

<p>Once I saw in the water a fish called a gurnard. He
seemed to have borrowed a sunset to dress himself
in. His scales were deep red and bronze. There
was a vivid blue on the edges of his fins. The fins
were in shape and coloring like a butterfly’s wings.</p>

<p>I never saw a boy who did not think that a trout
was one of the prettiest things ever made. Very
much of the beauty of fishes lies in the wonderful
scales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>But you must examine scales for yourselves. If you
have a microscope to look at them with, you will
be full of delight and surprise at what you see.
Once I looked through a very powerful microscope,
and thought I was looking at a lump of half-melted
gold set full of fine jewels. But it was the scale
of a fish.</p>

<p>I will now leave the scales, and tell you a little about
the teeth of fish. Fish have a great many teeth.
Their mouths are for the most part hard and horny,
and so covered with teeth that it is not likely that
they have very much sense of taste. Still there
are some kinds of fish that are almost, if not quite,
toothless.</p>

<p>If you open the mouth of a sea-trout you will find that
it is set entirely round, with sharp, strong teeth.
Then if you stretch the mouth open and look
into it, you will see that there is another row of
teeth set all round a bone inside the upper jaw.
Look still farther in, and you will see a row of
teeth on the middle bone in the roof of the mouth.
Look still beyond, and you will see a row of teeth
on each side of the tongue.</p>

<p>Some fish, besides all these teeth, have the tongue quite
covered with teeth. Others, that eat vegetables,
have little fine teeth all down the sides of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
throat. The French call such teeth as these,
“teeth in the velvet.” Some fish have the entire
mouth and throat lined with teeth.</p>

<p>These teeth may all be alike, not some “double” and
some “single” as you have. But sometimes fish
have teeth of different patterns. The most common
form of teeth in fish that live on fish or
other animal food, is that of a slim cone, bent a
little inward to hold firmly the fish caught, so that
it cannot slip away.</p>

<p>The fish that feed on weeds have short, roundish teeth
with a flat top, to make a good mill with which
to grind or crush their food. Fish that eat insects
do not need such large teeth. They have a great
number of little teeth almost as fine as hairs.
Rows of these teeth look like a little brush.</p>

<p>Some fish are said to have “mill” teeth, as the carp,
because their large flat teeth roll upon each other
like the stones of a mill grinding grain.</p>

<p>The ray fish, that feed on crabs, shell-fish, and flat fish,
need very strong teeth for crushing such food.
If you should look into their mouths, you would
see that they are made like a mill, and the upper
and under teeth roll against each other and crush
fine all that is between them. By looking at the
mouth of fish and examining its teeth, you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
find out what kind of food it used, just as by looking
at the beak and claws of a bird, you can tell
what were its habits and food.</p>

<p>Some fish have the inside of the stomach thick and furrowed,
very like the gizzard of a fowl. This is to
aid in cutting or grinding up the food. The teeth
of a carp have much the appearance of the teeth
of sheep and cows, only they are much smaller.
They work against a plate of gristle in the roof of
the mouth and reduce the food to pulp.</p>

<p>The strong, sharp teeth of fish are used not only for
eating their food, but for biting and fighting other
fish. Two great salmon have been known to fight
until one was killed. The dead one was found to
be badly wounded and torn by the teeth of its
enemy.</p>

<p>Pike have very sharp, strong teeth, and a big pike has
been known to seize hold of the foot or nose of a
dog, fox, or other animal, that came to the water’s
edge to drink.</p>

<p>The mouth of a dog-fish is set back on the under side
of the head. This mouth has a row of strong,
sharp teeth all round it. When the fish seizes its
prey or its enemy with its teeth, it whirls itself
over, and this action enables it to tear out a large
piece of the flesh held by its teeth.</p>

<p class="ph3">BIG AND LITTLE BROTHERS.</p>


<p>Yesterday, as I was going along the street, I saw a
large globe full of tiny fish. They were from one
to two inches long. I stopped to examine them.
They were sticklebacks. You must know that
little Mr. Stickleback is a very pretty and curious
fellow, and well worth buying.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_283" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_283.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE LITTLE HOUSE BUILDER.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking into this globe made me think of some of the
queer things I have heard and seen of this little
fish. Shall I tell you about him?</p>

<p>The stickleback gets his name from the fact that some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
of his fins, one on the back and one on the lower
part of the body, have changed to spines or thorns.
Different kinds of stickleback have three, four,
ten, fifteen, of these thorns.</p>

<p>This little fellow is one of the smallest and prettiest of
fishes. He is slender, and from one to three inches
long. The general length is about an inch and a
half. His body is silver below, green and purple
in bands on the back, and red and gold on the
head and sides. His fins are thin as finest silk.
I never saw a prettier little creature.</p>

<p>The stickleback is very greedy, very fearless, full of
courage, very affectionate, and of all fishes is the
most devoted parent. Finally, the stickleback
can build a house.</p>

<p>The colors of the stickleback brighten or fade according
as he feels glad or sad. If he has lost his
mate, his home, or his young ones, or if he has
been beaten in a fight, he swims off to hide, and
his colors grow dull. If he has beaten his enemy,
if his children and mate are quite safe in the little
house where he has put them, he gleams and
glows like a rainbow.</p>

<p>Sticklebacks are so fearless that when they are in a
pond no noise or shadow will alarm them. You
can even catch them without a hook just by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
dropping among them a string with a worm on it.
You may pull up the string with two sticklebacks
fast, one on each end of the worm. Little English
boys take this way of catching these tiny fish for
their globes.</p>

<p>When put into a globe or box, they fight sharply at
first. They strike each other with their spines,
whirl, dart, pretend to be beaten, and then leap
back to the fight. They are real little soldiers.
Finally, when they have found out which of them
all is the strongest, each one chooses his own
corner, or shelter by a stone for a home, and
defends that against all strangers.</p>

<p>The different varieties of sticklebacks build different
kinds of houses. One makes a nest like a muff
among water-weeds. I will tell you of one kind
of nest. The little fish carries straws and bits
of grass and moss, and tucks them down into the
gravel and sand. He glues them with the glue
from his skin.</p>

<p>While he is at work he holds and carries his material
with his mouth, and presses it into place with his
body. Having laid a floor, he builds a little hut
of woven fibres and moss. This hut is about as
large round as a twenty-five-cent piece. A little
door is at the top. He tries the strength of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
house by stirring up the water near it with his
tail.</p>

<p>When all is done Mr. Stickleback swims off to find his
mate. He seems to tell her that the house is
ready. She is a lazy little creature, and does
nothing but frolic in the water. She goes along
to the new home, and goes in to lay some eggs
there. Mr. Stickleback proudly swims up and
down before the home to keep foes away.</p>

<p>The little mate being fond of play does not like to stay
in the house long. She lays a few eggs about the
size of poppy seeds. Then she bites a hole in the
house and runs away! Next day little Mr.
Stickleback goes to find her, and coaxes her
back. This goes on for several days, until a
great number of bright yellow eggs, like seeds,
are laid in the nest.</p>

<p>After this, it is a whole month before the little fish
will hatch. Meantime other fish and other sticklebacks
will eat them, if they get the chance. All
that month the kind, brave little stickleback
swims up and down near his nest, and drives off
enemies. He will let no fish, not even his mate,
come near his treasure.</p>

<p>Finally, out come the wee, wee fish. Now the poor
little father has a harder time than ever. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
other fish want to eat up the young fry. The
food of sticklebacks is grubs, tiny insects, and
very small fry. As they are very hungry and
greedy, they are on the watch to pick up the new
little fish. But the stickleback, however hungry,
never eats his own little ones. He leaves such
vile conduct to the dog-fish.</p>

<p>As the little ones grow, they are very active, and want
to stray away from their home. Their father
knows they would get into danger, so he watches,
and chases each runaway back into its home
bounds, where he can take care of them all.</p>

<p>Finally, the little ones are so nearly grown that they
can fight for themselves. They can pick up
their own food, and make their own houses.
Then they are allowed to go off and swim where
they choose.</p>

<p>As I have told you about a very little fish, I will now
tell you something of a very big fish. The sturgeon
is a great fish which lives in the waters of
many countries. He is found in some of our
rivers. The body and head of the sturgeon are
partly covered with five long lines of great bony
plates. These plates are grooved, and have a
sharp point in the centre. They make good
armor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>Sturgeon are fond of playing and leaping from the
water. They are often speared by people standing
on rocks or in boats. I have seen very big
ones taken from the Niagara River. In the Ohio
and Mississippi the curious spoon-bill or paddle-fish
sturgeon are found. In some of our other
rivers the shovel-headed sturgeon lives.</p>

<p>The flesh of the sturgeon is good for food. The Russians
make isinglass from the air bladder of the
sturgeon, and one or two kinds of food are prepared
from its roe and flesh. Of the isinglass
prepared from the sturgeon, jelly is made. Glue
is very plentiful in the skin and bones of the sturgeon,
and a kind of food is made from the spinal
marrow.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you much about the uses of fish.
You all know that they form a large part of the
food of men, and many birds and beasts. Glue is
made from fish-bones and skins.</p>

<p>From many fish are made those substances that I told
you farmers put upon their land to restore the
minerals eaten out by the plants.</p>

<p>Oil is also made from fish. From parts of the cod an
oil very useful for medicine is obtained. From
other fish, lamp oil and machine oil are pressed.
A little fish in the Caspian Sea is so oily that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
it is dried its body burns with a clear light.
These dried fish are used as candles. When the
Cossacks get hungry, and have nothing else for
supper, they eat their fish candles.</p>

<p>That terrible fish, the shark, is very useful after he
is dead. From his fins, fine gelatine is made.
From his skin, a leather-like substance called shagreen
is prepared. Shagreen is used in polishing
wood, and for covers of portfolios, instrument-cases,
and the like.</p>

<p>From the bones of the shark, buttons and ornaments
are made, and very costly canes from his backbone.
His teeth are very hard and white, and are
often mounted in gold and sold for ornaments.</p>

<p>There are many large and interesting books about fisheries,
manufactures of articles from fish, and about
the various kinds of fish, and their habits and
uses. I hope you will try to get some of these
books to read. In fact, I hope you will pursue
for yourselves all these studies in nature which
we have begun in the Nature Readers.</p>
